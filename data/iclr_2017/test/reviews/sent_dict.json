    "\nAfter rebuttal:\n\nThanks for reporting the AlexNet results. The fact that they are not great is not so bad by itself, and as the authors mention, it would be interesting to understand why this happens. But the fact that these results  were not in the paper (and in fact still are not there) is disturbing. Moreover, some claims in the paper look wrong in the light of these results, for example:\n- \"This suggests that our gains stem from the CC-GAN method rather than the use of a better architecture.\"\n- \"Since discrimination of real/fake in-paintings is more closely related to the target task of object classification than extracting a feature representation suitable for in-filling, it is not surprising that we are able to exceed the performance of Pathak et al.

Perhaps after a revision.\n\n--------\nInitial review:\n\nThe paper demonstrates an application of generative adversarial networks (GAN) to unsupervised feature learning. The authors show that the representation learned by the discriminator of a conditional GAN trained for image inpainting performs well on image classification. As a side-effect, fairly convincing inpaintings are produced.\n\nThe proposed method combines two existing ideas: using the discriminator of a GAN as a feature learner [Radford et al. 2015] and performing unsupervised feature learning with image inpainting [Pathak et al. 2016]. Therefore conceptual novelty of the paper is limited. On the plus side, the authors implement their idea well and demonstrate state-of-the-art results on STL-10 and good results on Pascal VOC (although Pascal experiments are incomplete, see below). Overall, I am in the borderline mode, and I will gladly raise the score if the authors address my concerns regarding the experiments.\n\n1) Experimental evaluation on Pascal VOC is not quite satisfactory. Comparison with prior work is unfair because the network architecture used by the authors (VGG) is different from the architecture used by all existing methods (AlexNet). It is great that the authors do not try to hide this fact in the paper, but I do not understand why the authors are not willing to simply run their method with AlexNet architecture, although two commenters asked them to do so. Such an experiment would strongly support authors\u2019 claims. Current reasoning that \u201cwe thought it reasonable to use more current models while making the difference clear\u201d is not convincing. It is great that better architectures lead to better results, but it is also very important to properly compare to prior work. On a related topic, Doersch et al. also tried using VGG architecture, would it be possible to compare to that? Yet another question: why are you not comparing to [Noroozi&Favaro, ECCV 2016] ? I would also like the authors to address the comment by Richard Zhang.\n\n2) Qualitative inpainting results are incomplete: comparison with previous methods (for instance, [Pathak et al 2016]) is missing, and it is impossible to compare different versions of the proposed method because different images are used for different variants. I realize there may be too little space in the main paper to show all the results, but many more results should be shown in the supplementary material. Quantitative results are missing.

    "A layer wise optimization for CNNs with ReLU activations and max-pooling is proposed and shown to correspond to a series of latent structured SVM problems. Using CCCP style optimization a monotonic decrease of the overall objective function can be guaranteed.\n\nSummary:\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nI think the discussed insights are very interesting but not presented convincingly. Firstly, claims are emphasized which are often violated in practice (e.g., no convergence guarantees due to mini-batches), statements could be validated more convincingly (e.g., is monotone convergence a curse or a blessing), the experimental evaluation should be extended. In summary, I think the paper requires some more attention to form a compelling story.\n\nQuality: I think some of the techniques could be described more carefully to better convey the intuition. At times apples are compared to oranges, e.g., back propagation is contrasted with CCCP.\nClarity: Some of the derivations and intuitions could be explained in more detail.\nOriginality: The suggested idea is reasonable albeit heuristics are required.\nSignificance: Since the experimental setup is somewhat limited according to my opinion, significance is hard to judge at this point in time.\n\nDetails:\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n1. I think the provided guarantees for the optimization procedure are certainly convenient theoretically but their practical relevance still needs to be demonstrated more convincingly, e.g., mini-batch optimization alleviates any form of monotonic decrease. Hence the emphasize in the paper is somewhat misguided according to my opinion and given he current experimental evaluation.\n\n2. In spirit similar is work by B. Amos and J.

The notation seemed inconsistent (particularly the use of l, p, and m), and I am still not confident that I understand the model being used.\n\nOriginality: The novelty comes from applying the RFN model (including the ReLU non-linearity and dropout training) to the problem of biclustering. It sounds like a good idea. \n\nSignificance: The proposed algorithm appears to be a useful tool for unsupervised data modelling, and the authors make a convincing argument that it is significant. (I.E. The previous state-of-the-art, FABIA, is widely used and this method both outperforms and addresses some of the practical difficulties with that method.)\n\nQuality: The experiments are high-quality. \n\nComments:\n1) The introduction claims that this method is much faster than FABIA because the use of rectified units allow it to be run on GPUs. It is not clear to me how this works. How many biclusters can be supported with this method? It looks like the number of biclusters used for this method in the experiments is only 3-5?\n2) The introduction claims that using dropout during training increases sparsity in the bicluster assignments. This seems like a reasonable hypothesis, but this claim should be supported with a better argument or experiments.\n3) How is the model deep?

    "Dear authors,\n\nThe authors' response clarified some of my confusion. But I still have the following question:\n\n-- The response said a first contribution is a different formulation: you divide the word embedding learning into two steps, step 1 looks for a low-rank X (by Riemannian optimization), step 2 factorizes X into two matrices (W, C). You are claiming that your model outperforms previous approaches that directly optimizes over (W, C). But since the end result (the factors) is the same, can the authors provide some intuition and justification why the proposed method works better?\n\nAs far as I can see, though parameterized differently, the first step of your method and previous methods (SGD) are both optimizing over low-rank matrices. Admittedly, Riemannian optimization avoids the rotational degree of freedom (the invertible matrix S you are mentioning in sec 2.3), but I am not 100% certain at this point this is the source of your gain; learning curves of objectives would help to see if Riemannian optimization is indeed more effective. \n\n-- Another detail I could not easily find is the following. You said a disadvantage of other approaches is that their factors W and C do not directly reflect similarity. Did you try to multiply the factors W and C from other optimizers and then factorize the product using the method in section 2.3, and use the new W for your downstream tasks? I am not sure if this would cause much difference in the performance.\n\nOverall, I think it is always interesting to apply advanced optimization techniques to machine learning problems. The current paper would be stronger from the machine learning perspective, if more thorough comparison and discussion (as mentioned above) are provided. On the other hand, my expertise is not in NLP and I leave it to other reviewers to decide the significance in experimental results.\n\n": [

Despite its simplicity, Doc2VecC significantly out-performs the winning solutions of the competition and several baseline methods, noticeably the dependency-tree RNNs introduced in [1], which relies on additional dependency parsers to compose sentence vectors from word embeddings. The performance of Doc2VecC is comparable (slightly worse) than the LSTM based methods or skip-thought vectors on this dataset. On the other hand, it is much faster to train and test. As reported in the original paper, training of the skip-thought vector models on the book corpus dataset takes around 2 weeks on GPU. In contrast, it takes less than 2 hours to learn the embeddings for Doc2VecC on a desktop with Intel i7 2.2Ghz cpu.\n\nI also provided more insight on why Skip-thought vectors did not perform well on the movie review dataset in Section 4.2 (Accuracy). \n\nI would greatly appreciate it if you could take another look at revisions and provide me with some feedbacks. \n\n[1] Socher, Richard, et al. \"Grounded compositional semantics for finding and describing images with sentences.\" Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics 2 (2014): 207-218.": [

    "EDIT: the revisions made to this paper are very thorough and address many of my concerns, and the paper is also easier to understand. i recommend the latest version of this paper for acceptance and have increased my score.\n\nThis paper presents a way of interpreting LSTM models, which are notable for their opaqueness. In particular, the authors propose decomposing the LSTM's predictions for a QA task into importance scores for words, which are then used to generate patterns that are used to find answers with a simple matching algorithm. On the WikiMovies dataset, the extracted pattern matching method achieves accuracies competitive with a normal LSTM, which shows the power of the proposed approach. \n\nI really like the motivation of the paper, as interpreting LSTMs is definitely still a work-in-progress, and the high performance of the pattern matching was surprising. However, several details of the pattern extraction process are not very clear, and  the evaluation is conducted on a very specific task, where predictions are made at every word. As such, I recommend the paper in its current form as a weak accept but hope that the authors clarify their approach, as I believe the proposed method is potentially useful for NLP researchers.\n\nComments:\n- Please introduce in more detail the specific QA tasks you are applying your models on before section 3.3, as it's not clear at that point that the answer is an entity within the document.\n- 3.3: is the softmax predicting a 0/1 value (e.g., is this word the answer or not?)\n- 3.3: what are the P and Q vectors? do you just mean that you are transforming the hidden state into a 2-dimensional vector for binary prediction?\n- how does performance of the pattern matching change with different cutoff constant values?\n- 5.2: are there questions whose answers are not entities? \n- how could the proposed approach be used when predictions aren't made at every word? is there any extension for, say, sentence-level sentiment classification?\n": [

The model is trained on the big artificial dataset and tested on the small target datasets (section 4.1)\n2. The model is pre-trained on the big artificial dataset like before, then fine-tuned on a few examples from the target dataset and tested on the remaining target examples. Several such models are trained using different sub-sets of fine-tuning examples. The results are tested against the performance of randomly intialized then fine-tuned models (section 4.2).\n3. The model is pre-trained on the big artificial dataset like before. The model is made of an embedding component and an encoder  component. Alternatively, each component is reset to a random initialization, to test the importance of the pre-training in each component. Then the model is fine-tuned on a few examples from the target dataset and tested on the remaining target examples. (section 4.3)\n\nI think what makes things difficult to follow is the fact that the test set is composed by several sub tasks, and sometimes what is reported is the mean performance across the tasks, sometimes the performance on a few tasks. Sometimes what we see is the mean performance of several models? You should report standard deviations also. Could you better explain what you mean by best validation ?\n\nInteresting and unpretentious work. The clarity of the presentation could be improved maybe by simplifying the experimental setup? The interesting conclusion I think is reported at the end of the section 4.1, when the nuanced difference between the datasets are exposed.\n\nMinor: unexplained acronyms: GRU, BT, CBT.\nbenfits p. 2\nsubsubset p. 6": [

    "First of all, I would like to thank the authors for putting this much work into a necessary but somewhat tedious topic. While I think the paper is somewhat below the standard of a conference paper (see detailed comments below), I would definitely love to see a version of this paper published with some of the issues ironed out. I also agree with many of the points raised by other reviewers and will not repeat them here.\n\nMajor points:\n\n-- \"As we saw in the previous section, the minima of deep network loss functions are for the most part decent.\"\n\nAll you said in the previous section was that theory shows that there are no bad minima under \"strong assumptions\". There is no practical proof that minima do not vary in quality.\n\n-- \"This implies that we probably do not need to take many precautions to avoid bad minima in practice. If all minima are decent, then the task of finding a \"decent minima quickly\" is reduced to the task of finding any minima quickly.\"\n\nFirst of all, as one of the reviewers pointed out, we are never guaranteed in practice to actually reach a local minimum. We could always hit a region of the objective function where the algorithm makes essentially no further progress. The final error level, in practice, actually does depend significantly on many factors such as (i) optimization algorithm (ii) learning rate schedule (iii) initialization of weights (iv) presence of unsupervised pretraining (v) whether neurons are added or eliminated during training etc. etc. Therefore, the task of optimizing neural networks is far from being \"reduced to finding any minima quickly\".\n\n-- Figure 1\n \nI don't like Figure 1, because it suggests to me that you diagnosed exactly where the transition between the two phases happened, which I don't think you did.\n \nAlso, the concept of having a fast-decaying error followed by a slow-decaying error is simple enough for readers to understand without a dedicated graph. Minor point on presentation: The red brace is positioned lower in the figure than the blue brace and the braces don't join up horizontally. Please be more careful.\n\n-- Misuse of the transient phase / minimization phase concept\n\nIn section 4.3, you talk about the transient and minimization phase of optimization. However, you have no way of diagnosing when or if your algorithm reaches the minimization phase. You seem to think that the minimization phase is simply the part of the optimization process where the error decreases slowly. AFAIK, this is not the case. The minimization phase is where the optimization algorithm enters the vicinity of the local minimum that can be approximated by the second-order Taylor expansion. For this to even occur, one would have to verify, for example, that the learning rate is small enough. You change the algorithm after 25%, 50% and 75% of training, but these points seem arbitrary. What is the minimization phase was reached at 99%, or 10 epochs after you decided to stop training?\n\n-- Only 1 dataset\n \nYou run most experiments on only 1 dataset (CIFAR). Please replicate with at least one more dataset.\n \n-- Many figures are unclear\n \nFor each figure, the following information are relevant: network used; dataset used; learning rate used; batch norm yes / no; whether figure shows train, test, or validation error. It should be easy for the reader to ascertain this information for all figures, not just for some.\n \n-- You say at the beginning of section 4.1 that each algorithm finds a different minimum as if this is a significant finding. However, this is obvious because the updates taken by these algorithms vary wildly. Keep in mind that there is an exponentially large number of minima. The probability of different algorithms choosing the same minimum is essentially zero because of their sheer number. The same would be true if you even shift the learning rate slightly or use a different random seed for minibatch generation etc. etc.\n  \n-- Lack of confidence intervals\n\nThe value of Figures 1, 2, 3 and 6 is limited is because it is unclear how these plots would change if the random seed were changed. We only get information for a single weight initialization and a single minibatch sequence. While figures 5 and 7 can be used to try and infer what confidence intervals around plots in figures 1, 2, 3 and 6 might look like, I think those confidence intervals should still be shown for at least a subset of the configurations presented.\n\n-- Lack of information regarding learning rate\n\nThere is big question mark left open regarding how all your results would change if different learning rates were used. You don't even tell us how you chose the learning rates from the intervals you gave in section 3.4.\n\n-- Lack of information regarding the absolute distance of interpolated points\n\nIn most figures, you interpolate between two or three trained weight configuration. However, you do not say how far the interpolated points are apart. This is highly significant, because if points are close together and there is a big \"hump\" between them, it means that those points are more \"brittle\" than if they are far apart and there is a big \"hump\" between them.\n \nMinor points:\n \n-- LSTM is not a fixed network architecture like NiN or VGG, but a layer type. LSTM would be equivalent to CNN. Also, the VGG paper has multiple versions of VGG. You should specify which one you used.\n  \n-- The font size for the legends in the upper triangle of Table 1 is too small. You can't just write \"best viewed in zoom\" in the table caption and pretend that somehow fixes the problem. Personally, I prefer no legend over an unreadable legend.": [

    "Here are answers to some common questions the authors have been asked about the current work in the past by readers of the manuscript. We hope these will help clarify any other questions our reviewers/readers might have.\n\nQ: Why doesn't the paper present numerical comparision to state-of-the-art/recent pruning techniques?\n\nA: Under certain motivational assumptions, it is understandable to demand benchmarking comparisons against state-of-the-art methods, but this may be missing the fundamental purpose of the present research. Our investigation is intended less to propose a competing alternative to existing pruning techniques and more to shed light on the limitations of generally accepted approaches to pruning and the degree to which increased numbers of parameters affect learning representations in neural networks. The paper does talk about most, if not all popoular pruning techniques out there. In fact, we examined the literature for numerical methods to approximate the importance of network elements, and the widely-cited 1st & 2nd order techniques proposed by Mozer, LeCun, Hassibi, Stork, et al. provided our initial inspiration. This is the jumping off point for our research in terms of key insights.\n\nQ: The idea of using Taylor series approximations seems interesting but not really effective.\n\nA: It is not effective when used as a pruning technique but it is VERY effective to test out the effectiveness of existing pruning techniques, which is what we do here. We have mentioned it multiple times in the paper that the motivation behind this work is NOT to propose a new pruning technique that will outperform all other techniques out there but to tap into learning representations to see how effective our established techniques are when seen from the perspective of representations. The Taylor series approximations play an important role here. A lot of pruning techniques out there use 2nd Order error gradients and assume that using them is the most effective way to prune networks. We have conclusively proved using the Taylor series that this is very much not the case. Our results with the brute-force method show us that there is a much larger extent to which networks can be pruned. This makes for a great starting-off point for future research to find methods that can produce similar results.\n\nQ: Why did you decide in favor of sigmoid activation functions instead of something more recent and more popular like ReLUs? \n\nA: As mentioned above, the main contribution of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of pruning entire neurons from trained networks, and offer novel insight on learning representations. We use Taylor methods to approximate the results achieved by the brute-force method but this is not an ideal solution to the problem, as we discuss. The 2nd order approximation technique will not work for ReLU networks because ReLUs do not have a 2nd derivative, unless we use the soft-plus function as a continuous approximation. Furthermore, due to the fact that we are approximating the error surface of a network element with respect to the output using a parabola, if there is no useful parabola to approximate this relationship, then the method breaks down. The derivatives of the activation function are simply parameters of the Taylor series. It doesn\u2019t cease to be a parabolic approximation or become more effective if we use a different doubly-differentiable activation function. \n\nQ: Why carry out your experiments on the MNIST dataset and not go for a larger and more practical image dataset?\n\nA: All experiments were necessarily carried out on optimally trained networks (not counting Section 4.5, which specifically examines non-optimally trained networks), so there is no way to improve them. We derived the algorithm assuming the well-studied sigmoid activation function. Furthermore, the MNIST dataset is a de-facto standard for demonstrating the potential of new techniques. A different dataset, task, activation function, or network architecture will not change the trends we see in the results but could make the results less interpretable. \n\nQ: The best setting is Iterative Re-ranking with Brute Force removal which is too expensive.\n\nA: The brute-force method is highly parallelizable, so time complexity is not necessarily a deal-breaker. Our focus is the proof of concept, and we intend to investigate potential speedups in future work. Also, since pruning is anyways a single step carried out after the training process is over (which usually takes orders of magnitude more time), this is potentially acceptable. \n\n\n": [

    "I did enjoy reading some of the introductions and background, in particular that of reminding readers of popular papers from the late 1980s and early 1990s. The idea of the proposal is straight forward: remove neurons based on the estimated change in the loss function from the packpropagation estimate with either first or second order backpropagation. The results are as expected that the first order method is worse then the second order method which in turn is worse than the brute force method.\n\nHowever, there are many reasons why I think that this work is not appropriate for ICLR. For one, there is now a much stronger comprehension of weight decay algorithms and their relation to Bayesian priors which has not been mentioned at all. I would think that any work in this regime would require at least some comments about this. Furthermore, there are many statements in the text that are not necessarily true, in particular in light of deep networks with modern regularization methods. For example, the authors state that the most accurate method is what they call brute-force. However, this assumes that the effects of each neurons are independent which might not be the case. So the serial order of removal is not necessarily the best. \n\nI also still think that this paper is unnecessarily long and the idea and the results could have been delivered in a much compressed way. I also don\u2019t think just writing a Q&A section is not enough, and the points should be included in the paper.\n": [

    "I do like the demonstration that including learning of auxiliary tasks does not interfere with the RL tasks but even helps. This is also not so surprising with deep networks. The deep structure of the model allows the model to learn first a good representation of the world on which it can base its solutions for specific goals. While even early representations do of course depend on the task performance itself, it is clear that there are common first stages in sensory representations like the need for edge detection etc. Thus, training by additional tasks will at least increase the effective training size. It is of course unclear how to adjust for this to make a fair comparison, but the paper could have included some more insights such as the change in representation with and without auxiliary training. \n\nI still strongly disagree with the implied definition of supervised or even self-supervised learning. The definition of unsupervised is learning without external labels. It does not matter if this comes from a human or for example from an expensive machine that is used to train a network so that a task can be solved later without this expensive machine. I would call EM a self-supervised method where labels are predicted from the model itself and used to bootstrap parameter learning.

You knock existing algorithms for being \"highly optimized\" to particular problems, but if every worthwhile problem has \"highly optimized\" solutions, what good is your work? \n\nAlso, please stop calling existing TSP solvers such as concorde a heuristic. Concorde produces solutions which are provably correct. Your approach does not, nor is it remotely close. From a practical perspective, this is an important distinction; I don't see why anyone would choose the latter when given the choice. The second paragraphs of the related work and introduction are guilty of this. Also in the related work - you say it solves cities with \"thousands of cities\" when it has solved a 85k problem. \n\nI'd also echo concerns about the toy-ness of the evaluation metrics here - 100 cities is 800x smaller than existing SOTA of 85k from TSPLib - a gap made exponentially larger by the combinatorial nature of the problem.\n\n": [

    "I think it would be useful to discuss the concept of *edge* of chaos here (see e.g. Bertschinger, Nachschlager - Real-Time Computation at the Edge of Chaos in Recurrent Neural Networks), i.e. the hypothesis that RNNs are optimal (in some sense) at the boundary between chaotic and deterministic regimes. Specifically, it would be nice to see if your network gets closer to this edge during training (I think it will).\n\nIt wasn't clear to me if you studied the chaoticity in the case *with* input... the \"epsilon-activation\" thing seems very nonstandard. Why didn't you just compute the mean Lyapunov exponent? You can do that with or without input. I think you might find that the RNN with input will approach the edge of chaos during training (Lyapunov exp gets closer to zero, probably starting from negative values in your case).\n\nThe LSTM phase space diagram in Fig. 2 looks pretty bad... I think that particular unit is not behaving well at all.

I think it will be among the strongest non-traditional applied deep learning work at ICLR and will receive a great deal of interest and attention from attendees.\n\n-----\n\nThis paper describes modern deep learning approach to the problem of predicting the medications taken by a patient during a period of time based solely upon the sequence of ICD-9 codes assigned to the patient during that same time period. This problem is formulated as a multilabel sequence classification (in contrast to language modeling, which is multiclass classification). They propose to use standard LSTM and GRU architectures with embedding layers to handle the sparse categorical inputs, similar to that described in related work by Choi, et al. In experiments using a cohort of ~610K patient records, they find that RNN models outperform strong baselines including an MLP and a random forest, as well as a common sense baseline. The differences in performance between the recurrent models and the MLP appear to be large enough to be significant, given the size of the test set.\n\nStrengths:\n- Very important problem. As the authors point out, two the value propositions of EHRs -- which have been widely adopted throughout the US due to a combination of legislation and billions of dollars in incentives from the federal government -- included more accurate records and fewer medication mistakes. These two benefits have largely failed to materialize. This seems like a major opportunity for data mining and machine learning.\n- Paper is well-written with lucid introduction and motivation, thorough discussion of related work, clear description of experiments and metrics, and interesting qualitative analysis of results.\n- Empirical results are solid with a strong win for RNNs over convincing baselines. This is in contrast to some recent related papers, including Lipton & Kale et al, ICLR 2016, where the gap between the RNN and MLP was relatively small, and Choi et al, MLHC 2016, which omitted many obvious baselines.\n- Discussion is thorough and thoughtful. The authors are right about the kidney code embedding results: this is a very promising result.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The authors make several unintuitive decisions related to data preprocessing and experimental design, foremost among them the choice NOT to use full patient sequences but instead only truncated patient sequences that each ends at randomly chosen time point. This does not necessarily invalidate their results, but it is somewhat unnatural and the explanation is difficult to follow, reducing the paper's potential impact. It is also reduces the RNN's potential advantage.\n- The chosen metrics seem appropriate, but non-experts may have trouble interpreting the absolute and relative performances (beyond the superficial, e.g., RNN score 0.01 more than NN!). The authors should invest some space in explaining (1) what level of performance -- for each metric -- would be necessary for the model to be useful in a real clinical setting and (2) whether the gaps between the various models are \"significant\" (even in an informal sense).\n- The paper proposes nothing novel in terms of methods, which is a serious weakness for a methods conference like ICLR. I think it is strong enough empirically (and sufficiently interesting in application) to warrant acceptance regardless, but there may be things the authors can do to make it more competitive. For example, one potential hypothesis is that higher capacity models are more prone to overfitting noisy targets. Is there some way to investigate this, perhaps by looking at the kinds of errors each model makes?\n\nI have a final comment: as a piece of clinical work, the paper has a huge weakness: the lack of ground truth labels for missing medications. Models are both trained and tested on data with noisy labels. For training, the authors are right that this shouldn't be a huge problem, provided the label noise is random (even class conditional isn't too big of a problem). For testing, though, this seems like it could skew metrics. Further, the assumption that the label noise is not systemic seems very unlikely given that these data are recorded by human clinicians. The cases shown in Appendix C lend some credence to this assertion: for Case 1, 7/26 actual medications received probabilities < 0.5. My hunch is that clinical reviewers would view the paper with great skepticism. The authors will need to get creative about evaluation -- or invest a lot of time/money in labeling data -- to really prove that this works.\n\nFor what it is worth, I hope that this paper is accepted as I think it will be of great interest to the ICLR community. However, I am borderline about whether I'd be willing to fight for its acceptance. If the authors can address the reviewers' critiques -- and in particular, dive into the question of overfitting the imperfect labels and provide some insights -- I might be willing to raise my score and lobby for acceptance.": [

The main changes are as follows\n\n- In response to requests for extensions to other datasets, we now have results on 2 different binary sentiment analysis datasets - Stanford Sentiment Treebank and Yelp reviews\n\n- We introduced a simpler, more general approach for extracting rules from LSTMs trained on document classification, and demonstrate that with some easy modifications it can replace our prior, more complex, rule extraction mechanism on WikiMovies.\n\n- Our rules now take the form of simple phrases, rather than allowing for variable-sized gaps between words as before\n\n- Our LSTM baseline on WikiMovies is now SOTA by nearly 4%, and the automatically extracted patterns outperform the manual patterns in the earlier version.\n\n- We added a discussion on instances correctly classified by the LSTM, but incorrectly classified by our rules-based algorithm\n\n- For simplicity, we changed our WikiMovies baseline to a unidirectional LSTM, and removed bidirectional LSTMs from the paper. Extension of our new approach to bidirectional LSTMs would be straightforward, but we feel would add unneeded complexity to the presentation\n\nAll told, we feel that these algorithms and results are simpler, more powerful and more general than our prior work, and we look forward to discussing them.": [

That work is a new form of optimization algorithm which is not the case here. And bayesian hyper-parameter optimization methods aim for multiple hyper-parameters but this work only tune one hyper-parameter.\nThe network architecture used for the experiments on CIFAR-10 is quite outdated and the performances are much poorer than any work that has published in last few years. So the comparison are not valid here, as if the paper claim the advantage of their method, they should use the state of the art network architecture and see if their claim still holds in that setting too.\nAs discussed before, the extra cost of hyper-parameter optimizers are only justified if the method could push the SOTA results in multiple modern datasets.\nIn summary, the general idea of having an actor-critic network as a meta-learner is an interesting idea.

However, I think it is not ready to publish in ICLR for the following reasons:\n\n- This paper is not related to representation learning. It may be more suitable for a general machine learning or data mining conference. \n\n- The proposed approach can only work for a small class of models and cannot apply to popular formulations,  such as SVM, logistic regression, and neural network. It is unclear why we want to use SGD for this specific type of formulations. For model like linear regression, the authors should compare their methods with linear programming approaches. Also, it is unclear why we need to develope parallel algorithm for linear regressio problems as they are relatively easy to solve unless the data are big (see next comment). \n\n- The dataset used in the paper are relatively small and can be only used for proving the concept. Most datasets considered in the paper can be solved in a few second using a single core CPU. Hogwild! is suitable for sparse dataset because of its asynchronized nature. On data that are very sparse, the proposed approach is only slightly better or is worse than Hogwild. For dense dataset, it is unclear why we need to use SYMSGD instead of simply parallelizing the gradient computation using GPUs. Put them together, the experiment results are not convincing. \n": [

    "Paper Summary\nThis paper makes two contributions -\n(1) A model for next step prediction, where the inputs and outputs are in the\nspace of affine transforms between adjacent frames.\n(2) An evaluation method in which the quality of the generated data is assessed\nby measuring the reduction in performance of another model (such as a\nclassifier) when tested on the generated data.\n\nThe authors show that according to this metric, the proposed model works better\nthan other baseline models (including the recent work of Mathieu et al. which\nuses adversarial training).\n\nStrengths\n- This paper attempts to solve a major problem in unsupervised learning\n  with videos, which is evaluating them.\n- The results show that using MSE in transform space does prevent the blurring\n  problem to a large extent (which is one of the main aims of this paper).\n- The results show that the generated data reduces the performance of the C3D\n  model on UCF-101 to a much less extent than other baselines.\n- The paper validates the assumption that videos can be approximated to quite a\n  few time steps by a sequence of affine transforms starting from an initial\nframe.\n\nWeaknesses\n- The proposed metric makes sense only if we truly just care about the performance\n  of a particular classifier on a given task. This significantly narrows the\nscope of applicability of this metric because arguably, one the important\nreasons for doing unsupervised learning is to come up a representation that is\nwidely applicable across a variety of tasks. The proposed metric would not help\nevaluate generative models designed to achieve this objective.\n\n- It is possible that one of the generative models being compared will interact\n  with the idiosyncrasies of the chosen classifier in unintended ways.\nTherefore, it would be hard to draw strong conclusions about the relative\nmerits of generative models from the results of such experiments. One way to\nameliorate this would be to use several different classifiers (C3D,\ndual-stream network, other state-of-the-art methods) and show that the ranking\nof different generative models is consistent across the choice of classifier.\nAdding such experiments would help increase certainty in the conclusions drawn\nin this paper.\n\n- Using only 4 or 8 input frames sampled at 25fps seems like very little context\n  if we really expect the model to extrapolate the kind of motion seen in\nUCF-101. The idea of working in the space of affine transforms would be much\nmore appealing if the model can be shown to really generated non-trivial motion\npatterns. Currently, the motion patterns seem to be almost linear\nextrapolations.\n\n- The model that predicts motion does not have access to content at all. It only\n  gets access to previous motion. It seems that this might be a disadvantage\nbecause the motion predictor cannot use any cues like object boundaries, or\ndecide what to do when two motion fields collide (it is probably easier to argue\nabout occlusions in content space).\n\nQuality/Clarity\nThe paper is clearly written and easy to follow. The assumptions are clearly\nspecified and validated. Experimental details seem adequate.\n\nOriginality\nThe idea of generating videos by predicting motion has been used previously.\nSeveral recent papers also use this idea. However the exact implementation in\nthis paper is new. The proposed evaluation protocol is novel.\n\nSignificance\nThe proposed evaluation method is an interesting alternative, especially if it\nis extended to include multiple classifiers representative of different\nstate-of-the-art approaches. Given how hard it is to evaluate generative models\nof videos, this paper could help start an effort to standardize on a benchmark\nset.\n\nMinor comments and suggestions\n\n(1) In the caption for Table 1: ``Each column shows the accuracy on the test set\nwhen taking a different number of input frames as input\" - ``input\" here refers\nto the input to the classifier (Output of the next step prediction model). However\nin the next sentence ``Our approach maps 16 \\times 16 patches into 8 \\times 8\nwith stride 4, and it takes 4 frames at the input\" - here ``input\" refers to\nthe input to the next step prediction model. It might be a good idea to rephrase\nthese sentences to make the distinction clear.\n\n(2) In order to better understand the space of affine transform\nparameters, it might help to include a histogram of these parameters in the\npaper. This can help us see at a glance, what is the typical range of these\n6 parameters, should we expect a lot of outliers, etc.\n\n(3) In order to compare transforms A and B, instead of ||A - B||^2, one\ncould consider A^{-1}B being close to identity as the metric. Did the authors\ntry this ?\n\n(4) \"The performance of the classifier on ground truth data is an upper bound on\nthe performance of any generative model.\" This is not *strictly* true. It is\npossible (though highly unlikely) that a generative model might make the data\nlook cleaner, sharper, or highlight some aspect of it which could improve the\nperformance of the classifier (even compared to ground truth). This is\nespecially true if the the generative model had access to the classifier, it\ncould then see what makes the classifier fire and highlight those discriminative\nfeatures in the generated output.\n\nOverall\nThis paper proposes future prediction in affine transform space. This does\nreduce blurriness and makes the videos look relatively realistic (at least to the\nC3D classifier). However, the paper can be improved by showing that the model can\npredict more non-trivial motion flows and the experiments can be strengthened by\nadding more classifiers besides than C3D.": [

The idea is to treat the network parameter optimization problem as a Bayesian inference problem (which is proposed previously by Graves) and formulate the active learning problem as that of sampling the most informative data, where the informativeness is defined by the variational free energy, which depends on the Fisher information. To reconcile the computational burden of computing the inverse of Fisher Information matrix, the authors proposed techniques to approximate it (which seems to be novel)\n\nI think that this paper initiates an interesting direction: one that adapts deep learning to label-expensive problems, via active learning.

    "Several reviewers have posted comments asking about the capability of the proposed model to capture long-term dependencies. This is a natural question since the model was designed so that units get activated when presented the correct feature, then relax to zero at a rate controlled by the forget gate. At a first glance it is unclear that such a simple mechanism could capture long term dependencies (the relaxing rates might be too fast).\n\nWe added a simple experiment in the paper showing that long term dependencies can be obtained by stacking multiple layers of the basic architecture (see Figure 4). We took a 2-layer, 224-unit CFN network trained on Penn Treebank and ran it with the following input data: The first 1000 inputs x_t are the first 1000 words of the test set of PTB; All subsequent inputs are set to zero, so that x_t=0 if t>1000. For each layer we then select the 10 units that decay the slowest after t>1000 and plotted them on Figure 4. The first layer retains information for about 10 time steps, whereas the second layer retains information for about 100 steps. Adding a third or fourth layer would then allow the architecture to retain information for even longer periods. We have not yet implemented a multi-layer network to handle tasks (other than language modeling) where such longer-term dependencies are needed, but we believe the main obstacle here is one of proper initialization and training rather than a shortcoming of the architecture itself.\n\nImportantly, this behavior (i.e. higher layers decay more slowly) can be explained analytically, see equation (11).\n\nOverall, we find it interesting that complexity and long-term dependencies can plausibly be obtained in a classical way (i.e. stacking layers) rather than relying on the intricate and hard to interpret dynamics of an LSTM.": [

    "Sorry for the late review -- I've been having technical problems with OpenReview which prevented me from posting.\n\nThis paper presents a method for learning to predict things from sets of data points. The method is a hierarchical version of the VAE, where the top layer consists of an abstract context unit that summarizes a dataset. Experiments show that the method is able to \"learn to learn\" by acquiring the ability to learn distributions from small numbers of examples.\n\nOverall, this paper is a nice addition to the literature on one- or few-shot learning.

Generally, we performed four aspects of works: (1) the result comparison of pruning + quantization between our method and Han et al.\u2019s method [1] was incorporated into the paper (please see Section 3.4 for details); (2) the result comparison of weight quantization between our method and vector quantization [2] was also incorporated into the paper (please see Section 3.4 for details); (3) we tried our best to improve the clarifications of our encoding method for weight quantization, definition of bit-width, detailed experimental settings and so on, and several rounds of proof-reading and revising were also conducted; (4) more experimental results (including the statistical analyses on the distribution of weights after quantization and our latest progress on developing INQ for deep CNNs with low-precision weights and low-precision activations) that reviewers may be interested were added to the paper as the supplementary materials.\n \nMoreover, to make our work fully reproducible, the code (along with an instruction manual) will be released to public as we promised in the paper submission.\n\n(1) To reviewer 1:\n\nQuestion1: \u201cAlso, the description of the pruning-inspired partitioning strategy could be clarified somewhat... e.g., the chosen splitting ratio of 50% only seems to be referenced in a figure caption and not the main text.\u201d\n\nFollowing your suggestion, we added detailed parameter settings (such as splitting ratio and etc.) to the respective sets of experiments described in Section 3 accordingly.\n\nQuestion 2: \u201cThe paper could use another second pass for writing style and grammar.\u201d\n\nFollowing your suggestion, we tried our best to do a much better work on revising and proof-reading, with the helps from the native colleagues in USA.\n\n(2) To reviewer 2:\n\nThanks for your recognition of the novelty of our method. We believe that our responses posted on Dec. 16, 2016 should well address your concern on the result comparison of pruning + quantization between our method and Han et al.\u2019s method [1]. Furthermore, detailed result comparisons can be found in Section 3.4 of the paper. It can be clearly seen that our method outperforms Han et al.\u2019s method [1] with significant margins.\n\n(3) To reviewer 3:\n\nQuestion 1: \u201c1) It would be good to incorporate some of the answers into the paper, mainly the results with pruning + this method as that can be compared fairly to Han et al. and outperforms it.\u201d\n\nFollowing your suggestion, we incorporated related results into the paper (please see Section 3.4 for details).\n\nQuestion 2: \u201cIt would be good to better explain the encoding method (my question 4) as it is not that clear from the paper (e.g. made me make a mistake in question 5 for the computation of n2).\u201d\n\nFollowing your suggestion, we revised related parts, especially the clarification of our encoding method based on our previous responses to your questions accordingly (please see Section 2.1 for details).\n\nQuestion 3: \"The \"5 bits\" is misleading as in fact what is used is variable length encoding (which is on average close to 5 bits) where: - 0 is represented with 1 bit, e.g. 0 - other values are represented with 5 bits, where the first bit is needed to distinguish from 0, and the remaining 4 bits represent the 16 different values for the powers of 2.\u201d\n\nFollowing your suggestion, we made a clear clarification on the definition of bit-width accordingly.\n\nReferences:\nSong Han, Jeff Pool, John Tran, and William J.

    "The authors have grouped recent work in convolutional neural network design (specifically with respect to image classification) to identify core design principles guiding the field at large. The 14 principles they produce (along with associated references) include a number of useful and correct observations that would be an asset to anyone unfamiliar with the field. The authors explore a number of architectures on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 guided by these principles.\n\nThe authors have collected a quality set of references on the subject and grouped them well which is valuable for young researchers. Clearly the authors explored a many of architectural changes as part of their experiments and publicly available code base is always nice.\n\nOverall the writing seems to jump around a bit and the motivations behind some design principles feel lost in the confusion. For example, \"Design Pattern 4: Increase Symmetry argues for architectural symmetry as a sign of beauty and quality\" is presented as one of 14 core design principles without any further justification. Similarly \"Design Pattern 6: Over-train includes any training method where the network is trained on a harder problem than necessary to improve generalization performance of inference\" is presented in the middle of a paragraph with no supporting references or further explanation.\n\nThe experimental portion of this paper feels scattered with many different approaches being presented based on subsets of the design principles. In general, these approaches either are minor modifications of existing networks (different FractalNet pooling strategies) or are novel architectures that do not perform well. The exception being the Fractal-of-Fractal network which achieves slightly improved accuracy but also introduces many more network parameters (increased capacity) over the original FractalNet.\n\n\nPreliminary rating:\nIt is a useful and perhaps noble task to collect and distill research from many sources to find patterns (and perhaps gaps) in the state of a field; however, some of the patterns presented do not seem well developed and include principles that are poorly explained. Furthermore, the innovative architectures motivated by the design principles either fall short or achieve slightly better accuracy by introducing many more parameters (Fractal-Of-Fractal networks).

    "The authors have put forward a sincere effort to investigate the \"fundamental nature of learning representations in neural networks\", a topic of great interest and importance to our field.  They propose to do this via a few simplistic pruning algorithms, to essentially monitor performance decay as a function of unit pruning.  This is an interesting idea and one that could potentially be instructive, though in total I don't think that has been achieved here.  \n\nFirst, I find the introduction of pruning lengthy and not particularly novel or surprising.  For example, Fig 1 is not necessary, nor is most of the preamble section 3.3.0.  The pruning algorithms themselves are sensible (though overly simplistic) approaches, which of course would not matter if they were effective in addressing the question.  However, in looking for contributions this paper makes, an interesting, pithy, or novel take on pruning is not one of them, in my opinion.\n\nSecond, and most relevant to my overall rating, Section 4 does not get deeper than scratching the surface.  The figures do not offer much beyond the expected decay in performance as a percentage of neurons removed or gain value.  The experiments themselves are not particularly deep, covering a toy problem and MNIST, which does not convince me that I can draw lessons to the broader story of neural networks more generally.  \n\nThird, there is no essential algorithmic, architectural, or mathematical insight, which I expect out of all but the most heavily experimental papers.": [

In my mind the greatest contribution of this paper is the movement beyond the relatively simple graphical model structure of the traditional VAEs and the introduction of more interesting structures to the deep learning community. \n\nComments:\n\n- It's not clear to me why this should be called a \"statistician\". Learning an approximate posterior over summary statistics is not the only imaginable way to summarize a dataset with a neural network. One could consider a maximum likelihood approach, etc. In general it felt like the paper could be more clear, if it avoided coining new terms like \"statistic network\" and stuck to the more accurate \"approximate posterior\".\n\n- The experiments are nice, and I appreciate the response to my question regarding \"one shot generation\". I still think that language needs to be clarified, specifically at the end of page 6. My understanding of Figure 5 is the following: Take an input set, compute the approximate posterior over the context vector, then generate from the forward model given samples from the approximate posterior. I would like clarification on the following: \n\n(a) Are the data point dependent vectors z generated from the forward model or taken from the approximate posterior? \n\n(b) I agree that the samples are of high-quality, but that is not a quantified statement. The advantage of VAEs over GANs is that we have natural ways of computing log-probabilities. To that end, one \"proper\" way of computing the \"one shot generation\" performance is to report log p(x | c) (where c is sampled from the approximate posterior) or log p(x) for held-out datasets. I suspect that log probability performance of these networks relative to a vanilla VAE without the context latent variable will be impressive. I still don't see a reason not to include that.": [

Instead of proposing another incremental improvement, the authors start out with a clear hypothesis and test it.

The results are interesting but difficult to assess in a true apples-to-apples manner.

No plots with the wall-time of optimization are presented, even though the success of methods like Adagrad was due to their wall-time performance, not the number of iterations.\n-Why was only a single learning rate learned? To accurately compare against other popular first order methods, why not train a separate RL model for each parameter, similar to how popular first-order methods adaptively change the learning rate for each parameter.\n-Since learning is a non-stationary process, while RL algorithms assume a stationary environment, why should we expect an RL algorithm to work for learning a learning rate?\n-In figure 6, how does the proposed method compare to something like early stopping?

    "The authors propose amortized SVGD, an amortized form of prior work on SVGD, which is a particle variational method that maximally decreases the KL divergence at each update. \"amortized SVGD\" is done by training a neural network to learn this dynamic. They then apply this idea to train energy-based models, which admit a tractable unnormalized density.\n\nIn SVGD, the main difference from just MAP is the addition of a \"repulsive force\" that prevents degeneracy by encouraging probability mass to be spread to locations outside the mode. How this is able to still act as a strong enough entropy-like term in high dimensions is curious. From my understanding of their previous work, this was not a problem as the only experiments were on toy and UCI data sets.\n\nIn the experimental results here, they apply the kernel on the hidden representation of an autoencoder, which seems key, similar to Li et al. (2015) where their kernel approach for MMD would not work as well otherwise. However, unlike Li et al. (2015) the autoencoder is part of the model itself and not fixed. This breaks much of the authors' proposed motivation and criticisms of prior work, if they must autoencode onto some low-dimensional space (putting most effort then on the autoencoder, which changes per iteration) before then applying their method.\n\nUnlike previous literature which uses inference networks, their amortized SVGD approach seems in fact slower than the non-amortized approach. This is because they must make the actual update on xi before then regressing to perform the update on eta (in previous approaches, this would be like having to perform local inferences before then updating inference network parameters, or at least partially performing the local inference). This seems quite costly during training.\n\nI recommend the paper be rejected, and that the authors provide more comprehensive experimental results, expecially around the influence of the autoencoder, the incremental updates versus full updates, and the training time of amortized vs non-amortized approaches. The current results are promising but unclear why given the many knobs that the authors are playing with.\n\nReferences\n\nLi, Y., Swersky, K., & Zemel, R. (2015).

    "The authors take on the task of figuring out a set of design patterns for current deep architectures - namely themes that are recurring in the literature.  If one may say so, a distributed representation of deep architectures. \n\nThere are two aspects of the paper that I particularly valued: firstly, the excellent review of recent works, which made me realize how many things I have been missing myself.  Secondly, the \"community service\" aspect of helping someone who starts figure out the \"coordinate system\" for deep architectures - this could potentially be more important than introducing yet-another trick of the trade, as most other submissions may do.\n\nHowever I think this work is still half-done, and even though working on this project is a great idea, the authors do not yet do it properly. \n\nFirstly, I am not too sure how the choice of these 14 patterns was made. Maxout for instance (pattern 14) is one of the many nonlinearities (PreLU, ReLU, ...) and I do not see how it stands on the same grounds as something as general as \"3 Strive for simplicity\".\n\nSimilarly some of the patterns are as vague as \"Increase symmetry\" and are backed up by statements such as \"we noted a special degree of elegance in the FractalNet\". I do not see how this leads to a design pattern that can be applied to a new architecture - or if it applies to anything other than the FractalNet. \n\nSome other patterns are phrased with weird names \"7 Cover the problem space\" - which I guess stands for dataset augmentation; or \"6 over-train\" which is not backed up by a single reference. Unless the authors relate it to regularization (text preceding \"overtrain\"), which then has no connection to the description of \"over-train\" provided by the authors (\"training a network on a harder problem to improve generalization\"). If \"harder problem\" means one where one adds an additional term (i.e. the regularizer), the authors are doing harm to the unexperienced reader, confusing \"regularization\" with something that sounds like \"overfitting\" (i.e. the exact opposite).\n\nFurthermore, the extensions proposed in Section 4 seem a bit off tune - in particular I could not figure out \n-how the Taylor Series networks stem from any of the design patterns proposed in the rest of the paper. \n-whether the text between 4.1 and 4.1.1 is another of the architecture innovations (and if yes, why it is not in the 4.1.2, or 4.1.0) \n-and, most importantly, how these design patterns would be deployed in practice to think of a new network. \n\nTo be more concrete, the authors mention that they propose the \"freeze-drop-path\" variant from \"symmetry considerations\" to \"drop-path\". \nIs this an application of the \"increase symmetry\" pattern? How would \"freeze-drop-path\" be more symmetric that \"drop-path\"?\n Can this be expressed concretely, or is it some intuitive guess? If the second, it is not really part of applying a pattern, in my understanding. If the first, this is missing. \n\n\nWhat I would have appreciated more (and would like to see in a revised version) would have been a table of \"design patterns\" on one axis, \"Deep network\" on another, and a breakdown of which network applies which design pattern. \n\nA big part of the previous work is also covered in cryptic language - some minimal explanation of what is taking place in the alternative works would be useful. \n\n\n  \n": [

    "The contribution of this paper can be summarized as:\n\n1, A TransGaussian model (in a similar idea of TransE) which models the subject / object embeddings in a parameterization of Gaussian distribution.  The model can be naturally adapted to path queries like the formulation of (Guu et al, 2015).\n2. Along with the entity / relation representations trained by TransGaussian, an LSTM + attention model is built on natural language questions, aiming at learning a distribution (not normalized though) over relations for question answering.\n3. Experiments on a generated WorldCup2014 dataset, focusing on path queries and conjunctive queries.\n\nOverall, I think the Gaussian parameterization exhibits some nice properties, and could be suitable to KB completion and question answering. However, some details and the main experimental results are not convincing enough to me.  The paper writing also needs to be improved. More comments below:\n\n[Major comments]\n\n- My main concern is that that evaluation results are NOT strong. Either knowledge base completion or KB-based question answering, there are many existing and competitive benchmarks (e.g., FB15k / WebQuestions). Experimenting with such a tiny WordCup2014 dataset is not convincing.  Moreover, the questions are just generated by a few templates, which is far from NL questions. I am not even not sure why we need to apply an LSTM in such scenario. The paper would be much stronger if you can demonstrate its effectiveness on the above benchmarks. \n\n- Conjunctive queries:  the current model assumes that all the detected entities in the question could be aligned to one or more relations and we can take conjunctions in the end. This assumption might be not always correct, so it is more necessary to justify this on real QA datasets.\n\n- The model is named as  \u201cGaussian attention\u201d and I kind of think it is not very closely related to well-known attention mechanism, but more related to KB embedding literature.\n\n[Minor comments]\n- I find Figure 2 a bit confusing. The first row of orange blocks denote KB relations, and the second row of those denote every single word of the NL question. Maybe make it clearer?\n\n- Besides \u201centity recognition\u201d, usually we still need an \u201centity linker\u201d component which links the text mention to the KB entity. \n": [

    "The framework of Gatys et al. demonstrated that correlation statistics (empirical Gram matrices) of deep feature responses provide an excellent characterisation of visual textures. This paper investigates in detail which kind of deep or shallow networks may work well in this framework. One of the main findings is that that very shallow nets, consisting of a single filter bank with random weights, work surprisingly well, and for simple and regular textures may produce results which are visually superior to complex data-adapted filters such as the ones in networks like VGG-19. More broadly, the paper contains an interesting and informative discussion on the strength and limitations on such methods for texture synthesis.\n\nFigure 4 shows that the optimisation of images with respect to shallow filter banks may result in texture images that have a lower VGG-19 loss than optimising the VGG-19 objective directly. This is imputed to the difficulty of optimising the highly non-linear VGG-19 cost function, which is a reasonable explanation. In the new supplementary material, the authors show that better optimisation results can be obtained by initialising the VGG-19-based optimisation with the shallow network optimisation results, which is a useful complement to the original experiments.\n\nThe main limitation of the paper is that it does not systematically compare different methods against a quantifiable objective. It is trivial to define image statistics that would allow to simply generate an exact copy of any reference texture, hence with very good visual quality. Such trivial statistics would also be very shallow. The aim is instead to capture a texture distribution, and measuring how well a method meets this challenge remains an open problem. Hence, while the empirical results seem to confirm the intuition that simple statistics are good enough for texture synthesis both in terms of quality and diversity (when compared to more complex statistics), it is difficult to conclusively confirm that this is the case.\n\nThe authors indicate that diversity could be measured in terms of entropy. This is reasonable, but, as they acknowledge in their answers to questions, difficult to do in practice. Furthermore, this would still not account for the other aspect of the problem, namely visual quality. They also suggest to perform a psychophysical assessment, which may be the only practical way of addressing this problem, but deem that to be material for future work.\n\nOverall, since evaluation of image generation is such an hard problem, I think the paper still has sufficient strengths to warrant publication in ICLR.

    "The paper explores a new technique for classless association, a milder unsupervised learning where we do not know the class labels exactly, but we have a prior about the examples that belong to the same class. Authors proposed a two stream architecture with two neural networks, as streams process examples from the same class simultaneously. Both streams rely on the target (pseudo classes or cluster indices) of each other, and the outputs an intermediate representation z, which is forced to match with a statistical distribution (uniform in their case). The model is trained with EM where the E step obtains the current statistical distribution given output vectors z, and M step updates the weights of the architecture given z and pseudo-classes. Experimental results on re-organized MNIST exhibits better performance compared to classical clustering algorithms (in terms of association accuracy and purity). The authors further provide comparison against a supervised method, where proposed architecture expectedly performs worse but with promising results.\n\nThe basic motivation of the architecture apparently relies on unlabeled data and agreement of the same pseudo-labels generated by two streams. But the paper is hard to follow and the motivation for the proposed architecture itself, is hidden in details. What is trying to be achieved by matching distributions and using the pseudo-targets of the each other? Perhaps the statistical distribution of the classes is assumed to be uniform but how will it extend to other priors, or even the case where we do not assume that we know the prior? The current setup needs justifications. \n\nWhat would be very interesting is to see two examples having the same class but one from MNIST, the other from Rotated-MNIST or Background-MNIST. Because it is hard to guess how different the examples in two streams. \n\nAt the end, I feel like the authors have found a very interesting approach for classless association which can be extended to lots of many-to-one problems. This is a good catch. I would like to see the idea in the future with some extensive experiments on large scale datasets and tasks. But the current version lacks the theoretical motivations and convincing experiments. I would definitely recommend this paper to be presented in ICLR workshop.\n\nFew more points:\nTypo: Figure1. second line in the caption \"that\" -> \"than\"\nNecessity of Equation 2 is not clear\nBatch size M is enormous compared to classical models, there is no explanation for this\nWhy uniform? should be clarified (of course it is the simplest prior to pick but just a few words about it would be good for completeness)\nTypo: Page 6, second paragraph line 3: \"that\" -> \"than\"": [

    "The paper formulates a number of rules for designing convolutional neural network architectures for image processing and computer vision problems. Essentially, it reads like a review paper about modern CNN architectures. It also proposes a few new architectural ideas inspired by these rules. These are experimentally evaluated on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, but seem to achieve relatively poor performance on these datasets (Table 1), so their merit is unclear to me.\n\nI'm not sure if such a collection of rules extracted from prior work warrants publication as a research paper. It is not a bad idea to try and summarise some of these observations now that CNNs have been the model of choice for computer vision tasks for a few years, and such a summary could be useful for newcomers. However, a lot of it seems to boil down to common sense (e.g. #1, #3, #7, #11). The rest of it might be more suited for an \"introduction to training CNNs\" course / blog post. It also seems to be a bit skewed towards recent work that was fairly incremental (e.g. a lot of attention is given to the flurry of ResNet variants).\n\nThe paper states that \"it is universal in all convolutional neural networks that the activations are downsampled and the number of channels increased from the input to the final layer\", which is wrong. We already discussed this previously re: my question about design pattern 5, but I think the answer that was given (\"the nature of design patterns is that they only apply some of the time\") does not excuse making such sweeping claims. This should probably be removed.\n\n\"We feel that normalization puts all the layer's input samples on more equal footing, which allows backprop to train more effectively\" (section 3.2, 2nd paragraph) is very vague language that has many possible interpretations and should probably be clarified. It also seems odd to start this sentence with \"we feel\", as this doesn't seem like the kind of thing one should have an opinion about. Such claims should be corroborated by experiments and measurements. There are several other instances of this issue across the paper.\n\nThe connection between Taylor series and the proposed Taylor Series Networks seems very tenuous and I don't think the name is appropriate. The resulting function is not even a polynomial as all the terms represent different functions -- f(x) + g(x)**2 + h(x)**3 + ... is not a particularly interesting object, it is just a nonlinear function of x.\n\nOverall, the paper reads like a collection of thoughts and ideas that are not very well delineated, and the experimental results are unconvincing.": [

The algorithm is simple and training seems easy. Concerning the originality, the proposed algorithm is a simple adaptation of graph convolutional networks (ref Defferrard 2016 in the paper) to a semi-supervised transductive setting. This is clearly mentioned in the paper, but the authors could better highlight the differences and novelty wrt this reference paper. Also, there is no comparison with the family of iterative classifiers, which usually compare favorably, both in performance and training time, with regularization based approaches, although they are mostly used in inductive settings. Below are some references for this family of methods.\n\nThe authors mention that more complex filters could be learned by stacking layers but they limit their architecture to one hidden layer.

    "The paper introduces a new pruning method for neural networks based on the second-order Taylor expansion and compares the results against a first-order method and brute-force pruning. It performs experiments of the three methods on several toy examples - including a two-layer network on MNIST - and shows that the second-order method behaves much worse then the brute-force baseline. In addition, from the success of the brute-force pruning the authors conclude that the hypothesis of Mozer et al - that neurons either contribute to performance or cancel out the effect of other neurons - is probably correct.\n\nThe authors put in considerable effort to explain all details of the paper clearly and at length, so the content of the paper is accessible even to people novel to pruning methods. Additionally, the authors have very carefully answered all questions that were coming up through the pre-review and have been very responsive.\n\nMy major criticism is that the paper lacks focus, does not have a concrete conclusion and does not explain what it adds to the literature. To make this apparent, I here summarise each paragraph of the conclusion section:\n\nParagraph 1: We do not benchmark / Pruning methods do not fare well against brute-force baseline / Some evidence for hypothesis of Mozer & Smolensky, but further investigation needed\n\nParagraph 2: Introduced 2nd order Taylor method / Does not fare well against baseline\n\nParagraph 3: Re-training may help but is not fair\n\nParagraph 4: Brute-force can prune 40-70% in shallow networks\n\nParagraph 5: Brute-force less effective in deep networks\n\nParagraph 6: Not all neurons contribute equally to performance of network\n\nThe title of the paper and answers of the authors to the pre-review questions seemed to strongly suggest that the paper is not about the new second-order method, is not about benchmarking pruning algorithms but is instead about the learnt representations. But only two or three sentences in the conclusion, and no sentence in the part on results in the abstract, even refers to neural representations. In an answer to the pre-review questions the authors stated:\n\n> Furthermore, we do not have to accept the conclusion that re-training is a necessary part of pruning because a brute force search reveals that neurons can in fact be \n> pruned from trained networks in a piecemeal fashion with no retraining and minimal adverse effect on the overall performance of the network. This would be \n> impossible if neurons did not belong to the distinct classes we describe.\"\n\nBut this can already be concluded from the 2nd order method, which has a similar characteristic and is based on other 2nd order methods (not shown here). What is the motivation to introduce a new 2nd order method here?\n\nIn addition, some other minor conclusions about representations - in particular the cancellation effect - might be based on side-effects of the greedy serial pruning method. Optimally, one would need to consider all the different ways of pruning (which, of course, scales exponentially with the number of neurons and is computationally infeasible). Notably, the authors do consider this limitation in the context of conventional pruning methods in the conclusions: \"Third, we assumed that pruning could be done in a serial fashion [...]. We found that all of these assumptions are deeply flawed in the sense that the true relevance of a neuron can only be partially approximated [...] at certain stages of the pruning process\". But the brute-force pruning process is also serial - why is that not a problem?\n\nAll in all it is unclear to me what the paper adds: there are little conclusions regarding the learnt representations nor is there sufficient benchmarking against state-of-the-art pruning methods. I would suggest to focus the paper in the following way: first, use a state-of-the-art pruning method from the literature (that works without re-training) or do not use any other pruning methods besides brute-force (depending on whether you want to compare pruning methods against brute-force, or want to learn something about the learnt representations). In this way you need to write little about this second-order tuning methods, and readers are not so easily confused about the purpose of this paper (plus it will be considerably shorter!). Then concentrate on 2-layer MNIST and a deeper CIFAR10 network. Further focus the paper by adding an itemised list of the exact contributions that you make, and streamline the paper accordingly. These measures could strongly boost the impact of your work but will require a major revision.\n\nPS: I think the confusion starts with the following sentence in the abstract: \"In this work we set out to test several long-held hypothesis about neural network learning representations and numerical approaches to pruning.\" Both aspects are pretty orthogonal, but are completely mixed up in the paper.": [

    "The paper is dedicated to better understanding the optimization landscape in deep learning, in particular when explored with different optimization algorithms, and thus it also characterizes the behavior of these algorithms. It heavily re-uses the approach of Goodfellow et al. (2015). I find it hard to understand the contributions of the paper, for example: is it surprising that different algorithms reach different solutions when starting from the same initialization? It would be useful if the authors build such basic intuition in the paper. I also did not receive a clear answer to the question I posed to reviewers regarding clarifying how does the findings of the paper can contribute to future works on optimization in deep learning. And this is what I find fundamentally missing. So for example, there are probably plenty of ways to modify approach of Goodfellow et al. (2015), and similar works, and come up with interesting visualization methods for deep learning - but the question is: how is this helpful in terms of designing better algorithms, gaining more intuition how the optimization surface looks like in general, etc.? This is an interesting paper, though I am fairly confident it is a better fit for the journal than this conference. \n\nIt would be interesting and instructive, even for sanity check, to plot the eigenspectra of the solutions recovered by the algorithms to see the order of critical points recovered.": [

However, this observation by itself is not new and has come up in various other contexts such as matrix completion. As such the reviewers do not see sufficient novelty in the algorithmic aspects of the paper, and empirical evaluation on the specific problem of learning word embeddings does not show striking enough gains relative to standard SGD methods.

I expect the work will be interesting to people already implementing deep RL methods, but will probably not get much attention from the broader community.\n\nThe claims on p.1 suggest the approach is stable and sample efficience, and so I expected to see some theoretical analysis with respect to these properties.

    "The paper presents a method to learn a low-dimensional state representations from raw obervation for multi-task setting. In contrast to classic multi-task learning setting where a joint representation is usually learned by exploring the transferable information among different tasks, the method aims to identify individual task and solve them separately. To this end, the authors extend the learning with robotic priors approach by extending the loss function with additional term for task coherence, i.e., a task only changes representation between training episodes. The method has been evaluated on two tasks, multi-task slot-car racing and mobile navigation to prove its efficacy.\n\nthere were several unclear issues:\n\n1. The first question is that if the method is only appealing on the scenario like the slot-car racing, otherwise it should be benchmarked with mutli-task learning. While the author made the argument in the related work, the proposed method is orthogonal to multi-task learning they did admit both explore shared knowledge between tasks. What's the advantage and disadvantage for the proposed method for general mutiple task setting, in particular over the multi-task learning?\nThe reply of the authors was not fully satisfactory. The argument did not support the lack of comparison to multi-task joint-learning. It seems they don't plan to include any comparison neither. I think it's important for the fundamental motivation for the work, without such comparison, the method seems to be purely an alternative to multi-task joint-learning without any(or much) practical advantage.\n\n2.Following up to the previous question, please clarify the results on the mobile navigation scenario. It's not clear how the plot on the right indicates MT-LRP identifies all tasks as the author claimed and and seems very weak to support the method, in particular compared to the multi-slot car-racing driving experiment, there is too little results to make sound argument (almost no comparison to alternative methods, i.e. no baseline method, is that true for the problem).\nThe explanation of the authors did provide more details and more explicit information. \n\n3. The proposed gated neural network architecture seems to be a soft gated structure(correct me if I am wrong), a possible baseline would be a hard gated unit, how would this affect the conclusion. This is particularly interesting as the authors reflect on the constraint that the representation should stay consistent during the training.\nThe author simply stated again what they did for the modeling without counter the comparison to hard-gating, but it's probably less an issue compared to Question 1.\n\nIn summary, while there are remaining concerns about lacking comparisons, the is a weak tendency towards accepting the submission.": [

This avoids the use of special ending symbols which is larger in size and putting more things to learn for the parameters (shared with other symbols).\n\nThe authors test the DRNN using the tasks of recovering the synthetic trees and recovering functional programs. The model did better than traditional methods like seq2seq models.\n\nI think the recovering synthetic tree task is not very satisfying for two reasons \u2014 (1) the surface form itself already containing some of the topological information which makes the task easier than it should be (2) as we can see from figure 3, when the number of nodes grows (even to a number not very large), the performance of the model drops dramatically, I am not sure if a simple baseline only captures the topological information in the surface string would be much worse than this.

For example, we have the seq2seq parsing model (Vinyals et al, 2014), is it possible to use the DRNN proposed here on the decoder side?

One line of work has focused on using low-precision representations of the model weights, even down to 1 or 2 bits. However, so far these approaches have been accompanied by a significant impact on accuracy. The paper proposes an iterative quantization scheme, in which the network weights are quantized in stages---the largest weights (in absolute value) are quantized and fixed, while unquantized weights can adapt to compensate for any resulting error. The experimental results show this is extremely effective, yielding models with 4 bit or 3 bit weights with essentially no reduction in accuracy. While at 2 bits the accuracy decreases slightly, the results are substantially better than those achieved with other quantization approaches.\n\nOverall this paper is clear, the technique is as far as I am aware novel, the experiments are thorough and the results are very compelling, so I recommend acceptance.

    "This is a well written, organized, and presented paper that I enjoyed reading.  I commend the authors on their attention to the narrative and the explanations.  While it did not present any new methodology or architecture, it instead addressed an important application of predicting the medications a patient is using, given the record of billing codes.  The dataset they use is impressive and useful and, frankly, more interesting than the typical toy datasets in machine learning.  That said, the investigation of those results was not as deep as I thought it should have been in an empirical/applications paper.  Despite their focus on the application, I was encouraged to see the authors use cutting edge choices (eg Keras, adadelta, etc) in their architecture.  A few points of criticism:\n\n-The numerical results are in my view too brief.  Fig 4 is anecdotal, Fig 5 is essentially a negative result (tSNE is only in some places interpretable), so that leaves Table 1.  I recognize there is only one dataset, but this does not offer a vast amount of empirical evidence and analysis that one might expect out of a paper with no major algorithmic/theoretical advances.  To be clear I don't think this is disqualifying or deeply concerning; I simply found it a bit underwhelming.\n\n- To be constructive, re the results I would recommend removing Fig 5 and replacing that with some more meaningful analysis of performance.  I found Fig 5 to be mostly uninformative, other than as a negative result, which I think can be stated in a sentence rather than in a large figure.\n\n- There is a bit of jargon used and expertise required that may not be familiar to the typical ICLR reader.  I saw that another reviewer suggested perhaps ICLR is not the right venue for this work.  While I certainly see the reviewer's point that a medical or healthcare venue may be more suitable, I do want to cast my vote of keeping this paper here... our community benefits from more thoughtful and in depth applications. Instead I think this can be addressed by tightening up those points of jargon and making the results more easy to evaluate by an ICLR reader (that is, as it stands now researchers without medical experience have to take your results after Table 1 on faith, rather than getting to apply their well-trained quantitative eye). \n\nOverall, a nice paper.": [

Therefore, I do NOT understand how this method performs biclustering. \n\nTotally, I am not sure that this paper is suitable for publication. \n\nProns:\nEmpirical performance is good.\n\nCons:\nNovelty of the proposed method\nSome description in the paper is unclear.\n\n": [

    "This paper applies the pointer network architecture\u2014wherein an attention mechanism is fashioned to point to elements of an input sequence, allowing a decoder to output said elements\u2014in order to solve simple combinatorial optimization problems such as the well-known travelling salesman problem. The network is trained by reinforcement learning using an actor-critic method, with the actor trained using the REINFORCE method, and the critic used to estimate the reward baseline within the REINFORCE objective.\n\nThe paper is well written and easy to understand. Its use of a reinforcement learning and attention model framework to learn the structure of the space in which combinatorial problems of variable size can be tackled appears novel. Importantly, it provides an interesting research avenue for revisiting classical neural-based solutions to some combinatorial optimization problems, using recently-developed sequence-to-sequence approaches. As such, I think it merits consideration for the conference.\n\nI have a few comments and some important reservations with the paper:\n\n1) I take exception to the conclusion that the pointer network approach can handle general types of combinatorial optimization problems. The crux of combinatorial problems \u2014 for practical applications \u2014 lies in the complex constraints that define feasible solutions (e.g. simple generalizations of the TSP that involve time windows, or multiple salesmen). For these problems, it is no longer so simple to exclude possible solutions from the enumeration of the solution by just \u00ab striking off \u00bb previously-visited instances; in fact, for many of these problems, finding a single feasible solution might in general be a challenge. It would be relevant to include a discussion of whether the Neural Combinatorial Optimization approach could scale to these important classes of problems, and if so, how. My understanding is that this approach, as presented, would be mostly suitable for assignment problems with a very simple constraint structure.\n\n2) The operations research literature is replete with a large number of benchmark problems that have become standard to compare solver quality.

    "This paper builds upon the method of Jonschkowski & Brock to learn state representations for multiple tasks, rather than a single task. The research direction of learning representations for multiple tasks is an interesting one, and largely unexplored. The approach in the paper is to learn a different representation for each task, and a different policy for each task, where the task is detected automatically and built into the neural network.\n\nThe authors state that the proposed method is orthogonal to multi-task learning, though the end goal of learning to solve multiple tasks is the same. It would be interesting and helpful to see more discussion on this point in the paper, as discussed in the pre-review question phase. References to other multi-task learning works, e.g. policy distillation and actor-mimic (both ICLR \u201916), may be appropriate as well.\n\nThe method proposes to jointly learn a task classifier with a state representation learner, by using a differentiable gating mechanism to control the flow of information. The paper proposes a task coherence prior for this gating mechanism to ensure that the learned task classifier is temporally coherent. Introducing this structure is what enables the method to improve performance over the standard, non-multitask approach.\n\nThe evaluation involves two toy experimental scenarios. The first involves controlling one of two cars to drive around a track. In this task, detecting the \u201ctask\u201d is very easy, and the learned state representation is linear in the observation. The paper evaluates the performance of the policies learned with the proposed approach, and shows sufficient comparisons to demonstrate the usefulness of the approach over a standard non-multitask set-up.\n\nIn the second navigation scenario, only the state representation is qualitatively shown, not the resulting control policy nor any other learned state representations for comparison. Since the multi-task state representation learning approach is only useful if you can also learn control better, the paper should also evaluate on control, with the same comparisons as in the first experiment. Without this evaluation, the experiment is incomplete.\n\nLastly, to be on par with publications at a venue like ICLR, the method should be evaluated more thoroughly, on a wider range of set-ups, to demonstrate the generality of the approach and show that the method applies to more complex tasks. While in theory, the method should scale, the experiments do not demonstrate that it can handle more realistic scenarios, such as scaling beyond MNIST-level images, to 3D or real images, or higher-dimensional control tasks. Evaluating the method in this more complex scenario is important, because unexpected issues can come up when trying to scale. If scaling-up is straight-forward, then running this experiment (and including it in the paper) should be straight-forward.\n\nIn summary, here are the pros and cons of this paper:\nCons\n- The approach does not necessarily share information across tasks for better learning, and requires learning a different policy for each task\n- Only one experimental set-up that evaluates learned policy with multi-task state representation\n- No experiments on more realistic scenarios, such 3D environments or high-dimensional control problems\nPros: \n- This approach enables using the same network for multiple tasks, which is often not true for transfer and multi-task learning approaches\n- Novel way to learn a single policy for multiple tasks, including a task coherence prior which ensures that the task classification is meaningful\n- Experimentally validated on two toy tasks. One task shows improvement over baseline approaches\n\nThus, my rating would be higher if the paper included an evaluation of the control policy for navigation and included another more challenging and compelling scenario.\n\n\nLastly, here are some minor comments/questions on how I think the paper could be improved, but are not as important as the above:\n\nApproach:\nCould this approach be combined with other state representation learning approaches? e.g. approaches that use an autoencoder.\n\nExperiments:\nOne additional useful comparison would be to evaluate performance in the single-task setting (e.g. only controlling the red car), as an upper bound on how well the policy should be able to perform. Does the learned multi-task policy reach the same level of performance? This upper bound will be tighter than the \u201cknown car position\u201d baseline (which is also useful in its own right).\n\nDoes the \u201cobservations\u201d baseline eventually reach the performance of the LRP approach? It would be useful to know if this approach simply speeds up learning (significantly) or if it enables better performance.\n\nIf there are aliasing issues with the images, why not just use higher resolution images?": [

    "This paper considers the energy-based model interpretation of GAN, where the discriminator is an unnormalized model for the likelihood of a generative model p(x|theta) and the generator is a directed model that approximates this distribution. The generator is used to draw approximate negative phase samples that are used in stochastic maximum likelihood / contrastive divergence learning of the EBM / discriminator.\n\nThe main idea in the paper is to fit the generator by following the Stein variational gradient. In practice this gradient consists of the usual gradient provided by the discriminator with an added term that provides a repulsive force between the sampled data points to increase sample diversity.\n\nThe idea of using a kernel to push apart the sampled points is interesting, and will work in low dimensions, but it is hard to see how it can work in full scale images. For high dimensional samples x, the proposed kernel is unlikely to provide a useful distance measure between points. There are no convincing experiments in the paper that show otherwise. Specifically:\n\n- There is no experiment that compares between standard GAN and GAN + repulsion, using the same architecture. (please address this in the rebuttal)\n- If the Stein variational idea is taken literally, the right thing to do would be to fully optimize the generator at every step, and then taking a single optimization step on the discriminator. Instead, each is updated in turn, and the learning rates of both steps are adjusted to keep the two \"in line\".\n- The kernel used to fit the generator is defined in the auto-encoder space of the discriminator, and thus depends on the discriminator parameters. The objective that is used to fit the generator thus changes at every step, and the procedure can no longer be interpreted as stochastic gradient descent with respect to any single well defined objective.\n\nThe authors obtain good results: The generated images clearly look better than those generated by DCGAN. However, their approach has a number of changes compared to DCGAN, so it is not clear where the improvement comes from. In addition, by now the DCGAN is no longer a very strong baseline, as various other techniques have been proposed.\n\nNote: The use of phi for both the \"particle gradient direction\" and energy function is confusing": [

    "This paper describes an approach to predict (unseen) future frames of a video given a set of known past frames. The approach is based on a CNN that, in contrast to most related papers, work in the space of affine transformations (instead of pixels or flow). Said another way, the network takes as input a set of affine transforms that describe the motion of patches in the past frames, and likewise, outputs a set of affine transforms that predict future patch motion.\n\nTo that aim, the authors make a few simplifying hypotheses, namely, that a sequence of frames can be modeled accurately enough in their patch-affine framework. This is not unreasonable. A lot of papers in the optical flow community are based on similar hypotheses, i.e. model the flow as a smoothly varying affine field (for instance see \"Locally affine sparse-to-dense matching for motion and occlusion estimation\" by Leordeanu et al., \"EpicFlow: Edge-Preserving Interpolation of Correspondences for Optical Flow\" by Revaud et al., \"Optical Flow With Semantic Segmentation and Localized Layers\" by Sevilla-Lara et al.). These methods are state of the art, which gives a hint about the validity of this kind of approach. \nIn addition, it also seems very reasonable to reformulate the prediction task as predicting motion rather than predicting raw pixels. Indeed, the (patch-affine) motion space is considerably smaller than the image space, making the problem much more tractable and amenable to high-resolution videos.\n\nWhile I agree with the authors on these points, I also find that the paper suffer from important flaws. Specifically:\n\n  - the choice of not comparing with previous approaches in term of pixel prediction error seems very \"convenient\", to say the least. While it is clear that the evaluation metric is imperfect, it is not a reason to completely dismiss all quantitative comparisons with previous work. The frames output by the network on, e.g. the moving digits datasets (Figure 4), looks ok and can definitely be compared with other papers. Yet, the authors chose not to, which is suspicious.\n  \n  - The newly proposed metric poses several problems. First, action classification is evaluated with C3D, which is not a state-of-the-art approach at all for this task. Second, this metric actually *does not* evaluate what the network is claimed to do, that is, next frame prediction. Instead, it evaluates if another network, which was never trained to distinguish between real or synthetic frames by the way, can accurately classify an action from the predicted frames. I find that this proxy metric is only weakly related to what is supposed to be measured. In adition, it does not really make sense to train a network for something else that the final task it is evaluated for.\n  \n  - how is the affine motion of patches estimated? It is only explained that the problem is solved globally (not treating each patch independently) in a pretty vague manner. Estimating the motion of all patches is akin to solving the optical flow, which is still an active subject of research. Therefore, an important flaw of the paper lies in the potentially erroneous etimation of the motion input to the network. In the videos made available, it is clear that the motion is wrongly estimated sometimes. Since the entire approach depends on this input, I find it important to discuss this aspect. How do motion estimation failures impact the network? Also, the patch-affine hypothesis does not hold when patches are large enough that they cover several objects with contradictory motion.

That is, the network is trained to minimize the difference between (noisy) ground-truth and output affine transforms, instead of minimizing a loss in the actual output space (frame pixels) for which an (exact) ground-truth is available. It is true that the MSE loss on raw pixels leads to blurry results, but other types of losses do exist, for instance the gradient loss introduced by Mathieu et al. was shown to solve this issue.

    "This paper extends neural conversational models into the batch reinforcement learning setting. The idea is that you can collect human scoring data for some responses from a dialogue model, however such scores are expensive. Thus, it is natural to use off-policy learning \u2013 training a base policy on unsupervised data, deploying that policy to collect human scores, and then learning off-line from those scores.\n\nWhile the overall contribution is modest (extending off-policy actor-critic to the application of dialogue generation), the approach is well-motivated, and the paper is written clearly and is easy to understand. \n\nMy main concern is that the primary dataset used (restaurant recommendations) is very small (6000 conversations). In fact, it is several orders of magnitude smaller than other datasets used in the literature (e.g. Twitter, the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus) for dialogue generation. It is a bit surprising to me that RNN chatbots (with no additional structure) are able to generate reasonable utterances on such a small dataset. Wen et al. (2016) are able to do this on a similarly small restaurant dataset, but this is mostly because they map directly from dialogue states to surface form, rather than some embedding representation of the context. Thus, it remains to be seen if the approaches in this paper also result in improvements when much more unsupervised data is available.\n\nReferences:\n\nWen, Tsung-Hsien, Milica Gasic, Nikola Mrksic, Lina M.

    "This paper introduces a new reinforcement learning environment called \u00ab The Retro Learning Environment\u201d, that interfaces with the open-source LibRetro API to offer access to various emulators and associated games (i.e. similar to the Atari 2600 Arcade Learning Environment, but more generic). The first supported platform is the SNES, with 5 games (more consoles and games may be added later). Authors argue that SNES games pose more challenges than Atari\u2019s (due to more complex graphics, AI and game mechanics). Several DQN variants are evaluated in experiments, and it is also proposed to compare learning algorihms by letting them compete against each other in multiplayer games.\n\nI like the idea of going toward more complex games than those found on Atari 2600, and having an environment where new consoles and games can easily be added sounds promising. With OpenAI Universe and DeepMind Lab that just came out, though, I am not sure we really need another one right now. Especially since using ROMs of emulated games we do not own is technically illegal: it looks like this did not cause too much trouble for Atari but it might start raising eyebrows if the community moves to more advanced and recent games, especially some Nintendo still makes money from.\n\nBesides the introduction of the environment, it is good to have DQN benchmarks on five games, but this does not add a lot of value. The authors also mention as contribution \"A new benchmarking technique, allowing algorithms to compete against each other, rather than playing against the in-game AI\", but this seems a bit exaggerated to me: the idea of pitting AIs against each other has been at the core of many AI competitions for decades, so it is hardly something new. The finding that reinforcement learning algorithms tend to specialize to their opponent is also not particular surprising.\n\nOverall I believe this is an ok paper but I do not feel it brings enough to the table for a major conference. This does not mean, however, that this new environment won't find a spot in the (now somewhat crowded) space of game-playing frameworks.\n\nOther small comments:\n- There are lots of typos (way too many to mention them all)\n- It is said that Infinite Mario \"still serves as a benchmark platform\", however as far as I know it had to be shutdown due to Nintendo not being too happy about it\n- \"RLE requires an emulator and a computer version of the console game (ROM file) upon initialization rather than a ROM file only. The emulators are provided with RLE\" => how is that different from ALE that requires the emulator Stella which is also provided with ALE?\n- Why is there no DQN / DDDQN result on Super Mario?\n- It is not clear if Figure 2 displays the F-Zero results using reward shaping or not\n- The Du et al reference seems incomplete": [

    "This paper introduces a similarity encoder based on a standard feed-forward neural network with the aim of generating similarity-preserving embeddings. The approach is utilized to generate a simple extension of the CBOW word2vec model that transforms the learned embeddings by their average context vectors. Experiments are performed on an analogy task and named entity recognition.\n\nWhile this paper offers some reasonable intuitive arguments for why a feed-forward neural network can generate good similarity-preserving embeddings, the architecture and approach is far from novel. As far as I can tell, the model is nothing more than the most vanilla neural network trained with SGD on similarity signals.\n\nSlightly more original is the idea to use context embeddings to augment the expressive capacity of learned word representations. Of course, using explicit contextual information is not a new idea, especially for tasks like word sense disambiguation (see, e.g., 'Efficient Non-parametric Estimation of Multiple Embeddings per Word in Vector Space' by Neelakantan et al, which should also be cited), but the specific method used here is original, as far as I know.\n\nThe evaluation of the method is far from convincing. The corpora used to train the embeddings are far smaller than would ever be used in practice for unsupervised or semi-supervised embedding learning. The performance on the analogy task says little about the benefit of this method for larger corpora, and, as the authors mentioned in the comments, they expect \"the gain will be less significant, as the global context statistics brought in by the ConEc can also be picked up by word2vec with more training.\"\n\nThe argument can be made (and the authors do claim) that extrinsic evaluations are more important for real-world applications, so it is good to see experiments on NER. However, again the embeddings were trained on a very small corpus and I am not convinced that the observed benefit will persist when trained on larger corpora.\n\nOverall, I believe this paper offers little novelty and weak experimental evidence supporting its claims.

    "This paper introduces an actor-critic deep RL approach with experience replay, which combines truncated importance sampling and trust region policy optimization. The paper also proposes a new method called stochastic duelling networks to estimate the critic for continuous action spaces. The method is applied to Atari games and continuous control problems, where it yields performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.\n\nAs mentioned in the beginning of the paper, the main contributions of this work lies in combining 1) truncated importance sampling with retrace, 2) trust region policy optimization, and 3) stochastic duelling networks. These improvements work well and may be beneficial to future work in RL.\n\nHowever, each improvement appears to be quite incremental. Moreover, the ACER framework seems much more complex and fragile to implement compared to the standard deep q-learning with prioritized replay (which appears to perform just as well on Atari games). So for the Atari domain, I would still put my money on prioritized replay due to its simplicity. Thirdly, improving sample efficiency for deep RL is a laudable goal, but really this goal should be pursued in a problem setting where sample efficiency is important. Unfortunately, the paper only evaluates sample efficiency in the Atari and continuous control tasks domain; two domains where sample efficiency is not important. Thus, it is not clear that the proposed method ACER will generalize to problems where we really care about sample efficiency.\n\nSome technical aspects which need clarifications:\n- For Retrace, I assume that you compute recursively $Q^{ret}$ starting from the end of each trajectory? Please comment on this.\n- It's not clear to me how to derive eq. (7). Is an approximation (double tilde) sign missing?\n- In section 3.1 the paper argued that $Q^{ret}$ gives a lower-variance estimate of the action-value function. Then why not use it in eq. (8) for the bias correction term?\n- The paper states that it uses a replay memory of 50000 frames, so that across threads it is comparable in size to previous work. However, for each thread this is much smaller compared to earlier experiments on Atari games. For example, one million experience replay transitions were used in the paper \"Prioritized Experience Replay\" by Schaul et al. This may have a huge impact on performance of the models (both for ACER and for the competing models). In order to properly assess the improvements of ACER over previous work, the authors need to also experiment with larger experience replay memories.\n\n\nOther comments:\n- Please move Section 7 to the appendix.\n- \"Moreover, when using small values of lambda to reduce variance, occasional large importance weights can still cause instability\": I think what is meant is using *large* values of lambda.\n- Above eq. (6) mention that the squared error is used.\n- Missing a \"t\" subscript at the beginning of eq. (9)?\n- It was hard to understand the stochastic duelling networks. Please rephrase this part.\n- Please clarify this sentence \"To compare different agents, we adopt as our metric the median of the human normalized score over all 57 games.\"\n- Figure 2 (Bottom): Please add label to vertical axes.": [

    "This paper introduces dropout as a latent variable model (LVM). Leveraging this formulation authors analyze the dropout \u201cinference gap\u201d which they define to be the gap between network output during training (where an instance of dropout is used for every training sample) and test (where expected dropout values are used to scale node outputs).  They introduce the notion of expectation linearity and use this to derive bounds on the inference gap under some (mild) assumptions.  Furthermore, they propose use of per-sample based inference gap as a regularizer, and present analysis of accuracy of models with expectation-linearization constraints as compared to those without.\n\nOne relatively minor issue I see with the LVM view of dropout is that it seems applicable only to probabilistic models whereas dropout is more generally applicable to deep networks.  However I\u2019d expect that the regularizer formulation of dropout would be effective even in non-probabilistic models.\n\nMC dropout on page 8 is not defined, please define.\n\nOn page 9 it is mentioned that with the proposed regularizer the standard dropout networks achieve better results than when Monte Carlo dropout is used.  This seems to be the case only on MNIST dataset and not on CIFAR?\n\nFrom Tables 1 and 2 it also appears that MC dropout achieves best performance across tasks and methods but it is of course an expensive procedure.

    "This paper investigates the use of eligibility traces with recurrent DQN agents. As in other recent work on deep RL, the forward view of Sutton and Barto is used to make eligibility traces practical to use with neural networks. Experiments on the Atari games Pong and Tennis show that traces work better than standard Q-learning.\n\nThe paper is well written and the use of traces in deep RL is indeed underexplored, but the experiments in the paper are too limited and do not answer the most interesting questions.\n\nAs pointed out in the questions, n-step returns have been shown to work better than 1-step returns both in the classical RL literature and more recently with deep networks. [1] shows that using n-step returns in the forward view with neural networks leads to big improvements on both Atari and TORCS. Their n-step Q-learning method also combines returns of different length in expectation, while traces do this explicitly. This paper does not compare traces with n-step returns and simply shows that traces used in the forward view help on two Atari games. This is not a very significant result. It would be much more interesting to see whether traces improve on what is already known to work well with neural networks.\n\nThe other claimed contribution of the paper is showing the strong effect of optimization. As with traces, I find it hard to make any conclusions from experiments on two games with fixed hyperparameter settings. This has already been demonstrated with much more thorough experiments in other papers. One could argue that these experiments show that importance of hyperparameter values and not of the optimization algorithm itself. Without tuning the optimization hyperparameters it's hard to claim anything about the relative merits of the methods.\n\n[1] \"Asynchronous Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning\", ICML 2016.": [

    "This paper is methodologically very interesting, and just based on the methodological contribution I would vote for acceptance. However, the paper's sweeping claims of clearly beating existing baselines for TSP have been shown to not hold, with the local search method LK-H solving all the authors' instances to optimality -- in seconds on a CPU, compared to clearly suboptimal results by the authors' method in 25h on a GPU. \n\nSeeing this clear dominance of the local search method LK-H, I find it irresponsible by the authors that they left Figure 1 as it is -- with the line for \"local search\" referring to an obviously poor implementation by Google rather than the LK-H local search method that everyone uses. For example, at NIPS, I saw this Figure 1 being used in a talk (I am not sure anymore by whom, but I don't think it was by the authors), the narrative being \"RNNs now also clearly perform better than local search\". Of course, people would use a figure like that for that purpose, and it is clearly up to the authors to avoid such misconceptions. \n\nThe right course of action upon realizing the real strength of local search with LK-H would've been to make \"local search\" the same line as \"Optimal\", showing that the authors' method is still far worse than proper local search. But the authors chose to leave the figure as it was, still suggesting that their method is far better than local search. Probably the authors didn't even think about this, but this of course will mislead the many superficial readers. To people outside of deep learning, this must look like a sensational yet obviously wrong claim. I thus vote for rejection despite the interesting method. \n\n------------------------\n\nUpdate after rebuttal and changes:\n\nI'm torn about this paper. \n\nOn the one hand, the paper is very well written and I do think the method is very interesting and promising. I'd even like to try it and improve it in the future. So, from that point of view a clear accept.\n\nOn the other hand, the paper was using extremely poor baselines, making the authors' method appear sensationally strong in comparison, and over the course of many iterations of reviewer questions and anonymous feedback, this has come down to the authors' methods being far inferior to the state of the art. That's fine (I expected that all along), but the problem is that the authors don't seem to want this to be true... E.g., they make statements, such as \"We find that both greedy approaches are time-efficient and just a few percents worse than optimality.\"\nThat statement may be true, but it is very well known in the TSP community that it is typically quite trivial to get to a few percent worse than optimality. What's hard and interesting is to push those last few percent. \n(As a side note: the authors probably don't stop LK-H once it has found the optimal solution, like they do with their own method after finding a local optimum. LK-H is an anytime algorithm, so even if it ran for a day that doesn't mean that it didn't find the optimal solution after milliseconds -- and a solution a few percent suboptimal even faster).\n\nNevertheless, since the claims have been toned down over the course of the many iterations, I was starting to feel more positive about this paper when just re-reading it. That is, until I got to the section on Knapsack solving. The version of the paper I reviewed was not bad here, as it at least stated two simple heuristics that yield optimal solutions:\n\n\"Two simple heuristics are ExpKnap, which employs brand-and-bound with Linear Programming bounds (Pisinger, 1995), and MinKnap, which employs dynamic programming with enumerative bounds (Pisinger, 1997). Exact solutions can also be optained by quantizing the weights to high precisions and then performing dynamic programming with a pseudo-polynomial complexity (Bertsimas & Demir, 2002).\" That version then went on to show that these simple heuristics were already optimal, just like their own method.\n\nIn a revision between December 11 and 14, however, that paragraph, along with the optimal results of ExpKnap and MinKnap seems to have been dropped, and the authors instead introduced two new poor baseline methods (random search and greedy). This was likely in an effort to find some methods that are not optimal on these very easy instances. I personally find it pointless to present results for random search here, as nobody would use that for TSP. It's like comparing results on MNIST against a decision stump (yes, you'll do better than that, but that is not surprising). The results for greedy are interesting to see. However, dropping the strong results of the simple heuristics ExpKnap and MinKnap (and their entire discussion) appears unresponsible, since the resulting table in the new version of the paper now suggests that the authors' method is better than all baselines. Of course, if all that one is after is a column of bold numbers for ones own approach that's what one can do, but I don't find it responsible to hide the better baselines. Also, why don't the authors try at least the same OR-tools solver from Google that they tried for TSP? It seems to support Knapsack directly: ": [

    "This paper poses an interesting idea: removing chaotic behavior or RNNs.\nWhile many other papers on new RNN architecture usually focus too much on the performance improvement and leave the analysis part on their success as a black-box, this paper does a good job on presenting why its method may work well.\n\nAlthough, the paper shows lots of comparison between the chaotic systems (GRUs & LSTMs) and the stable system (proposed CFN model), the reviewer is not fully convinced by the main claim of this paper, the nuance that chaotic behaviour makes dynamic system to have rich representation power but makes the system too unstable. In the paper, the LSTM shows a very sensitive behaviour, even when a very small amount of noise is added to the input. However, it still performs surprisingly well with this chaotic behaviour. \n\nMeasuring the model complexity is a very difficult task, therefore, many papers manage to use either same number of hidden units or choose approximately close model sizes. In this paper, the experiments were carried by using the same amount of parameters for both the LSTM and CFN. However, I think the CFN may have much more simpler computational graph. Taking the idea of this work, can we develop a stable dynamic system, but which does not only have one attractor?\n\nIt is also interesting to see that the layers of CFNs are updated in different timescales in a sense that the decaying speed decreases when the layer gets higher. Could you provide more statistics on this? For example, what is the average relaxation time of the whole hidden units at each layer?\n\nBatch normalization and layer normalization can be helpful to make the training of RNNs become more stable. How would the behaviour of batch normalized or perhaps layer normalized LSTM look like? Also, it is often not trivial to make batch normalization or layer normalization to work on a new architecture. I think it may be useful to compare batch normalized or layer normalized versions of the LSTM and CFN.\n\nThe quality of the work is good, explanation is clear enough along with nice analyses and proofs. Overall, the performance is not any better than LSTMs, but it is still interesting when thinking of simplicity of this model. I am a bit concerned if this model might not work that well in more harder task, e.g., translation.

Experiments shows the proposed method has better speedup than previous methods like Hogwild! and Allreduce.\n\nI feel that there might be some fundamental misunderstanding on SGD.\n\n''The combiner matrixM  generate above can be quite large and expensive to compute. The sequential SGD algorithm maintains and updates the weight vector w , and thus requires O(f)  space and time, where f  is the number of features. In contrast,M  is a f f  matrix and consequently, the space and time complexity of parallel SGD is O(f^2) . In practice, this would mean that we would need O(f) processors to see constant speedups, an infeasible proposition particularly for datasets that can have\nthousands if not millions of features.\"\n\nI do not think one needs O(f^2) space and complexity for updating M_i * v, where v is an f-dimensional vector. Note that M_i is a low rank matrix in the form of (I - a_i a_i'). The complexity and space can be reduced to O(f) if compute it by O(v - a_i (a_i' v)) equivalently. If M_i is defined in the form of the product of n number of rank 1 matrices. The complexity and space complexity is O(fn). In the context of this paper, n should be much smaller than f. I seriously doubt that all author's assumptions, experiments, and strategies in this paper are based on this incorrect assumption on space and complexity of SGD. \n\nWhy one can have speedup is unclear for me. It is unclear what computations are in parallel and why this sequential algorithms can bring speedup if M_i*v is computed in the most efficient way.\nI suggest authors to make the following changes to make this paper more clear and theoretically solid\n- provide computational complexity per step of the proposed algorithm\n- convergence rate analysis (convergence analysis is not enough): we would like to see how the dimension reduction can affect the complexity.\n": [

If they have trouble training the vanilla GAN on Pascal even on the 64*64 image size, this should be mentioned in the paper and be explained.

    "This paper proposes a new approaches for optimizing the objective of CNNs. The proposed method uses a lay-wise optimization, i.e. at each step, it optimizes the parameters in one layer of CNN while fixing the parameters in other layers. The key insight of this paper is that, for a large class of CNNs, the optimization problem at a particular can be formulated as optimizing a piecewise linear (PL) function. This PL function optimization happens to be the optimization problem commonly encountered in latent structural SVM. This connection allows this paper to borrows ideas from the latent structural SVM literature, in particular concave-convex procedure, to learn the parameters of CNNs.\n\nOverall, the paper is well-written. Traditional, CNNs and structural SVMs are almost two separate research communties. The connection of CNNs to latent structural SVM is interesting, and might bridge the gap and facilitate the transferring of ideas between these two camps.\n\nOf course, the proposed method also has some limitations. 1) It is limited to layer-wise optimization. Nowadays layer-wise optimization is essentially a coordinate descent algorithm and is not really a competitive strategy in learning CNNs. When you choose layer-wise optimization, you already lose something in terms of optimizing the objective (since you are using coordinate descent, instead of gradient descent). Of course, you also gain something since now you can guarantee that each coordinate descent step always improve the objective. It is not clear to me how the loss/gain balances each other. 2) This paper focues on improving the optimization of CNN objective. However, we all know that a better objective does not necessarily correspond to a good model (e.g. due to overfitting). Although the SGD with backprop in standard CNN learning does not always improve the solution of the objective (unlike the proposed method in this paper), but to me, this might be a good thing since it can prevent overfitting (the goal of learning is not to get better solution for the optimization problem in the first place -- the optimization problem is merely a proxy to learn a model with good generalization ability).\n\nThe experiment is a bit weak.\n1) Only CIFAR10 is used. This is a very small dataset by today's standard, while CNNs are typically used in large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet. It is not clear whether the conclusions of this paper still hold when applied on ImageNet.\n\n2) This paper only compares with a crippled variant of SGD (without batch normalization, dropout, etc). Although this paper mentions that the reason is that it wants to focus on optimization. But I mentioned earlier, SGD is not designed to purely obtain the best solution that optimizes the objective, the goal of SGD is to reasonably optimize the objective, while preventing overfitting. So the comparison to SGD purely in terms of the optimization is that meaningful in the first place. \n": [

The proposed method is applied to a factoid question-answering task, where it is demonstrated that the extracted rules perform comparatively to the original LSTM. The analysis of the extracted rules illustrate the features the LSTM model picks up on.\n\nAnalyzing and visualizing the computations carried out by RNNs in order to understand the functions they compute is an important direction of research. This sort of analysis will help us understand the pitfalls of RNNs, and how we can improve them. Although the approach taken is relatively inflexible - each rule is defined as an ordered sequence of words - the authors experiment with three different scores for picking salient words (state-difference, cell-difference and gradient) and their approach yields comparable performance, which suggests that the extracted rules mimic the RNN closely. The results are also somewhat surprising, since most of the rules consist only of two or three words.\n\nIt would have been interesting to try extend the approach on other natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation.

    "This paper proposes an amortized version of the Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) method in which \"a neural network is trained to mimic the SVGD dynamics\". It applies the method to generative adversarial training to yield a training procedure where the discriminator is interpreted as an energy-based probabilistic model.\n\nOne criticism I have of the presentation is that a lot of time and energy is spent setting the table for a method which is claimed to be widely applicable, and the scope of the empirical evaluation is narrowed down to a single specific setting. In my view, either the paper falls short of its goal of showing how widely applicable the proposed method is, or it spends too much time setting the table for SteinGAN and not enough time evaluating it.\n\nThe consequence of this is that the empirical results are insufficient in justifying the approach proposed by the paper. As another reviewer pointed out, DCGAN is becoming outdated as a benchmark for comparison.\n\nQualitatively, SteinGAN samples don't look significantly better than DCGAN samples, except for the CelebA dataset. In that particular case, the DCGAN samples don't appear to be the ones presented in the original paper; where do they come from?\n\nQuantitatively, DCGAN beats SteinGAN by a small margin for the ImageNet Inception Score and SteinGAN beats DCGAN by an even smaller margin for the CIFAR10 Inception Score. Also, in my opinion, the \"testing accuracy\" score is not a convincing evaluation metric: while it is true that it measures the amount of information captured in the simulated image sets, it is only sensitive to information useful for the discrimination task, not for the more general modeling task. For instance, this score is likely completely blind to information present in the background of the image.\n\nBecause of the reasons outlined above, I don't think the paper is ready for publication at ICLR.": [

    "This paper proposes learning document embeddings as a sum of the constituent word embeddings, which are jointly learned and randomly dropped out ('corrupted') during training. While none of the pieces of this model are particularly novel, the result is an efficient learning algorithm for document representation with good empirical performance.\n\nJoint training of word and document embeddings is not a new idea, nor is the idea of enforcing the document to be represented by the sum of its word embeddings (see, e.g. '\u201cThe Sum of Its Parts\u201d: Joint Learning of Word and Phrase Representations with Autoencoders' by Lebret and Collobert). Furthermore, the corruption mechanism is nothing other than traditional dropout on the input layer. Coupled with the word2vec-style loss and training methods, this paper offers little on the novelty front.\n\nOn the other hand, it is very efficient at generation time, requiring only an average of the word embeddings rather than a complicated inference step as in Doc2Vec. Moreover, by construction, the embedding captures salient global information about the document -- it captures specifically that information that aids in local-context prediction. For such a simple model, the performance on sentiment analysis and document classification is quite encouraging.\n\nOverall, despite the lack of novelty, the simplicity, efficiency, and performance of this model make it worthy of wider readership and study, and I recommend acceptance.": [

    "This paper proposes the graph convolutional networks, motivated from approximating graph convolutions.  In one propagation step, what the model does can be simplified as, first linearly transform the node representations for each node, and then multiply the transformed node representations with the normalized affinity matrix (with self-connections added), and then pass through nonlinearity.\n\nThis model is used for semi-supervised learning on graphs, and in the experiments it demonstrated quite impressive results compared to other baselines, outperforming them by a significant margin.  The evaluation of propagation model is also interesting, where different variants of the model and design decisions are evaluated and compared.\n\nIt is surprising that such a simple model works so much better than all the baselines.  Considering that the model used is just a two-layer model in most experiments, this is really surprising as a two-layer model is very local, and the output of a node can only be affected by nodes in a 2-hop neighborhood, and no longer range interactions can play any roles in this.  Since computation is quite efficient (sec. 6.3), I wonder if adding more layers helped anything or not.\n\nEven though motivated from graph convolutions, when simplified as the paper suggests, the operations the model does are quite simple.  Compared to Duvenaud et al. 2015 and Li et al. 2016, the proposed method is simpler and does almost strictly less things.  So how would the proposed GCN compare against these methods?\n\nOverall I think this model is simple, but the connection to graph convolutions is interesting, and the experiment results are quite good.

However, the contribution is relatively incremental given previous work on RL for navigation and on auxiliary tasks. The work could become of greater interest provided broader analysis and insights on either optimal combinations of tasks for visual navigation (e.g. the value of other visual / geometry-based tasks), or on auxiliary tasks with RL in general.

While these tasks assume a 3D environment as well some position information, such priors are well suited to a large variety of tasks pertaining to navigation and robotics.\n\nExtensive experiments suggest to incorporating such auxiliary tasks increase performance and to a large extent learning speed.\nAdditional analysis of value functions and internal representations suggest that some structure is being discovered by the model, which would not be without the auxiliary tasks.\n\n\nWhile specific to 3D-environment tasks, this work provides additional proof that using input data in addition to sparse external reward signals helps to boost learning speed as well as learning better internal representation. It is original, clearly presented, and strongly supported by empirical evidence.\n\nOne small downside of the experimental method (or maybe just the results shown) is that by picking top-5 runs, it is hard to judge whether such a model is better suited to the particular hyperparameter range that was chosen, or is simply more robust to these hyperparameter settings. Maybe an analysis of performance as a function of hyperparameters would help confirm the superiority of the approach to the baselines. My own suspicion is that adding auxiliary tasks would make the model robust to bad hyperparameters.\n\nAnother downside is that the authors dismiss navigation literature as \"not RL\".

    "We highly appreciate the time and feedback from all the reviewers, all of which we will take into serious consideration in our revision. We will particularly strengthen and clarify the empirical experiments. Below we address some of the major points: \n\n[Testing Accuracy Score]\nWe agree with the reviewers' point on the \"testing accuracy\" score, but think that it still provides some valuable insight about the dataset. Its blindness to the background can be a good thing in that it captures more information about the \"effective amount\" of objects the dataset contains.  The problem is that it is very difficult to obtain a *perfect* score, and reporting more than one metrics (in an objective fashion) can help to gain more comprehensive understandings. \n\n[Repulsive Term in High Dimension]\nOur repulsive force works due to two tricks: 1) scaling the bandwidth with the data diversity using the median trick, which alleviates the exponential decay of RBF kernel. 2) define kernel on the feature space instead of the raw pixels of the images, which allows us to respect the manifold structure of the images. The framework of SVGD allows us to use any positive definite kernels and change it adaptively during iterations, because the kernel only defines the \"tangent space\" for improvement. \n\nSteinGAN without kernel corresponds to Viterbi training of the energy model and we find it work well with careful tuning of parameters, but tend to converge to a small number of bad-looking images after running a large number of iterations; adding the kernel under the same setting helps prevent this problem. Our current results on CIFAR10 shows that SteinGAN without kernel gives an inception score of 6.34, while that SteinGAN with kernel gives 6.76. \n\n[Amortized is slower than non-amortized]\nAlthough the amortized algorithm has the overhead of updating $\\xi$, it stores the information in a generative network, and allows us to simulate as many images as we need. By using the one-step gradient update we proposed, the update of $\\xi$ is the same as standard backpropagation except replacing the Dlogp with the SVGD gradient. ": [

We ask reviewers to evaluate the new version of the paper and adjust their reviews if necessary.\n\n1) Previous Figure 1, which was problematic due to different possible interpretations of \u201clocal search\u201d was removed.\n\n2) We added precise running time evaluations for all of the methods in the paper. Table 3 presents running time of the RL pretraining-greedy method and the solvers we compare against. Table 4 presents the performance and corresponding running time of RL pretraining-Sampling and RL pretraining-Active Search as a function of the number solutions considered. It shows how they can be stopped early at the cost of a small performance degradation. Table 6 contains the same information for the metaheuristics from OR-Tools vehicle routing library solver. We controlled the complexity of these approaches by letting all of them evaluate 1,280,000 solutions. Section 5.2 was rewritten in light of the new results.\n\n3) We experimented with a new approach, called RL pretraining-Greedy@16, that decodes greedily from 16 different pretrained models at inference time and selects the shortest tour. It runs as fast as the solvers while only suffering from a small performance cost.\n\n4) We added a discussion in Section 6 (Generalization to other problems) explaining how one may apply Neural Combinatorial Optimization to problems for which coming up with a feasible solution is challenging by itself.\n\n5) We added a more detailed description of the critic network (see Section 4 - Critic\u2019s architecture for TSP).\n\nPlease take a look and let us know your thoughts.": [

    "We thank the three reviewers. The one common concern is ablations. This paper proposes several new ideas, and then goes on to combine these ideas.  \n\nTo answer the reviewers concerns about ablations, we added a new figure (Figure 4). This is an extremely important figure and we urge the reviewers and readers to consult it as it should answer any concerns and highlight the value of the many contributions made in this paper. The figure shows that each ingredient (Retrace/Q-lambda with off-policy correction, stochastic dueling nets, and the NEW trust region method) on its own leads to a massive improvement. Likewise, truncation with bias correction plays an important role for large action spaces (control of humanoid). This figure indicates that this paper is not about making 4 small contributions and combining them. Rather it is about making 4 important contributions, which are all essential to obtain a stable, scalable, general, off-policy actor critic. Attaining this has been a holy grail, and this paper shows how to do it.\n\nGiven our good results, we could easily have written several papers; one for each contribution. Instead, we chose to do the honest thing and write a single solid 20-page paper aimed at truly building powerful deep RL agents for both continuous and discrete action spaces. The paper also presents novel theoretical results for RL, and a very comprehensive experimental study. \n\nWe did not want to claim state-of-the-art on Atari because this often depends on how one chooses to measure what should be state-of-the-art (eg sample complexity, highest median, highest mean, etc.). But clearly, in terms of median, ACER with 1 replay achieves a higher median score that any previously reported result. Note that this result is not just for a few games, but for the entire set of 57 games. The UNREAL agent submitted to this conference is the only method we know that achieves a higher median, but it does so by adding auxiliary tasks to A3C and massive hyper-parameter sweeps. We could also add auxiliary tasks to ACER and do hyper-parameter sweeps to further improve it, but this is left for future work as we wanted to focus on designing a powerful core RL agent.\n\nWe hope this reply and in particular the ablations clearly answer your concerns. With 3 6\u2019s this thorough paper will be rejected despite the several novel contributions it makes, new theoretical analysis, and excellent results on a comprehensive set of tasks. We hope you take the ablations and this reply into consideration to choose your final scores. \n": [

    "We would like to thank all reviewers for their thorough and helpful comments!\n\n1) Before we turn to the individual questions raised the reviewers, we would like to address the main issue that all reviewers raised, namely the relationship of our method to multi-task learning:\n\n\u201cThe authors state that the proposed method is orthogonal to multi-task learning though the end goal of learning to solve multiple tasks is the same.\u201d (AnonReviewer1)\n\u201cThe argument did not support the lack of comparison to multi-task joint-learning.\u201d (AnonReviewer2)\n\u201cLimiting the multi-task learning to be different to individual tasks rather than sharing and transferring knowledge between tasks\u201d (AnonReviewer 3)\n\nThe intro has been rewritten to clarify our motivation and how our work compares to multi-task learning. We completely agree that successful RL will require multi-task learning to share knowledge that generalizes over multiple tasks. \n\nBut there are sets of tasks that require multiple dedicated skills without sharing knowledge. For instance, in a video game, an agent have to achieve several subgoals (fight an enemy, avoid obstacles,...), each of these can be seen as individual task. Learning multiple, (sub-)policies dedicated to *different* tasks is a problem of its own right, as it faces significant theoretical issues, such as \u201ccatastrophic forgetting\u201d. We have elaborated on this argument in the introduction.\n\nSince there is few work approaching this problem in RL, our paper studies the question of how to learn fully independent policies for different tasks. We fully agree that future work will need to combine learning shared and separate representations but we regard our work on the  independent-policy multi-task RL problem as a contribution in itself. \n\nWe now reply to the individual comments raised by the reviewers.\n\n----\n\nAnonReviewer1\n\n1) \u201cReferences to other multi-task learning works, e.g. policy distillation and actor-mimic (both ICLR \u201916), may be appropriate as well.\u201d\n\nThank you for the pointers, we have integrated the two suggested papers in the related work of the paper.\n\n2) \u201cThe approach does not necessarily share information across tasks for better learning, and requires learning a different policy for each task\u201d\n\nThis is the very idea of the method proposed, we updated the introduction to clarify the reasons we focused on this approach.\n\n3) \u201cIn the second navigation scenario, only the state representation is qualitatively shown, not the resulting control policy nor any other learned state representations for comparison. Since the multi-task state representation learning approach is only useful if you can also learn control better, the paper should also evaluate on control, with the same comparisons as in the first experiment. Without this evaluation, the experiment is incomplete.\u201d\n\nWe agree and as mentioned before this was a preliminary and incomplete experiment, and we decided to remove it from the paper. \n\n4) \u201cLastly, to be on par with publications at a venue like ICLR, the method should be evaluated more thoroughly, on a wider range of set-ups [...]\u201d\n\nWe agree that it is beneficial to apply a method to a wider range of tasks. Yet, we chose to invest into rigorously evaluating the performance of the method on the chosen task, and provide a thorough argument why and how the method works. We believe that it will scale to a wider range of tasks, but we will have to address this in future work.\n\n5) \u201cCould this approach be combined with other state representation learning approaches? e.g. approaches that use an autoencoder.\u201d\n\nYes, in principle it would be possible to use other state representation learning objectives.  Note, however, that in the slot car racing scenario a PCA/auto-encoder loss will not perform as well as LRP, as it has will try to explain all variations in the observation, in particular the second slot car. This has been shown in our previous work (Jonschkowski & Brock 2015) and is also reflected in the performance of PCA in the slot-car experiment.\n\n6) \u201dOne additional useful comparison would be to evaluate performance in the single-task setting (e.g. only controlling the red car), as an upper bound on how well the policy should be able to perform. Does the learned multi-task policy reach the same level of performance? This upper bound will be tighter than the \u201cknown car position\u201d baseline (which is also useful in its own right).\u201d\n\nThank you for this suggestion; in our experiment, however, the performance of the car in the single-task setting is identical to the performance we see in the multi-task setting. The reason is that the task detector module has a very high accuracy (greater than 99%) for the slot car tasks, and in consequence, a separate policy for each slot car is learned.\n\n7) \u201cDoes the \u201cobservations\u201d baseline eventually reach the performance of the LRP approach? It would be useful to know if this approach simply speeds up learning (significantly) or if it enables better performance.\u201d\n\nOur experiments and previous work (Jonschkowski & Brock 2015) suggest that it will eventually reach the same performance with enough data, but for now, even in our largest experiments, we did not see it happening.\n\n8) \u201cIf there are aliasing issues with the images, why not just use higher resolution images?\u201d\n\nMainly computational reasons: we wanted to evaluate a wide variety of parameter settings and study their influence on our algorithm, yet we did not have the computational power to do this exhaustively on higher resolutions.\n\n---\n\nAnonReviewer2\n\n1) \u201cThe author simply stated again what they did for the modeling without counter the comparison to hard-gating, but it's probably less an issue compared to Question 1.\u201d\n\nWe are sorry that our answer in the pre-review phase did not address your question. We were trying to explain that our method is technically a soft gating, but effectively learns to perform hard gating. We are not sure how whether and how using a hard would influence the conclusion of the paper, and we are not aware of a way to implement a differentiable hard gate (if it is not differentiable, we cannot train it using backpropagation).\n\n---\n\nAnonReviewer3\n\n2) \u201cParameters choice is arbitrary (w parameters)\u201d\nThe weights w for the different methods are chosen as described in Jonschkowski & Brock 2015, by monitoring the gradient on a small part of the training set. The goal is to have gradients of the same magnitude for the different terms in the loss, so only relative weighting matters. Small changes to the parameters do not affect the method and there is no need for careful tuning.\n\n3) \u201cThe experiments could have been conducted using a standardized simulation tool such as OpenAI Gym to make it easy to compare.\u201d\nWe agree that evaluating experiments on a standardized tool such as OpenAI gym is a great idea. We want to point out, though, that the slot car racing task considered in the paper is a well-known task that has been evaluated in previous work, too, e.g. (Lange et al., 2012). Moreover, it is the simplest task that has the properties we are interested in this paper (non-overlapping tasks).\nBut we agree that that open simulation tools such as OpenAI gym are great and we will apply our method to these tasks in future work.": [

    "summary\n\nThe paper explains dropout with a latent variable model where the dropout variable (0 or 1 depending on which units should be dropped) is not observed and is accordingly marginalised. Maximum likelihood under this model is not tractable but standard dropout then corresponds to a simple Monte Carlo approximation of ML for this model.\n\nThe paper then introduces a theoretical framework for analysing the discrepancy (called inference gap) between the model at training (model ensemble, or here the latent variable model), and the model at testing (where usually what should be an expectation over the activations over many models becomes the activation of one model with averaged weights).\nThis framework introduces several notions (e.g. expectation linearity) which allow the study of which transition functions (and more generally layers) can have a small inference gap. Theorem 3 gives a bound on the inference gap.\n\nFinally a new regularisation term is introduced to account for minimisation of the inference gap during learning.\n\nExperiments are performed on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 and show that the method has the potential to perform better than standard dropout and at the level of Monte Carlo Dropout (the standard method to compute the real dropout outputs consistently with the training assumption of an ensemble, of course quite expensive computationally)\n\n\nThe study gives a very interesting theoretical model for dropout as a latent variable model where standard dropout is then a monte carlo approximation. This is very probably widely applicable to further studies of dropout.\n\nThe framework for the study of the inference gap is interesting although maybe somewhat less widely applicable.\n\nThe proposed model is convincing although 1. it is tested on simple datasets 2. the gains are relatively small and 3. there is an increased computational cost during training because a new hyper-parameter is introduced.\n\np6 line 8 typo: expecatation": [
